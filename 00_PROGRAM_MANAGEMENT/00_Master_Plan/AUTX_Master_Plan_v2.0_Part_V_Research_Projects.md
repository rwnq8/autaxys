**Autaxys Research & Development Master Plan (v2.0)**

**Part V: Research Framework** (Continued)

**6.0 Detailed Research Projects**

This section outlines the specific, actionable research projects designed to advance the autaxys framework and the field of autology. These projects are organized under the overarching Research Pillars defined in Section 5.0 (in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Framework_Intro_Pillars.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Framework_Intro_Pillars.md)) and are designed to address the Open Questions and Identified Gaps outlined in Section 3.7 (in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)). They represent the concrete tasks required to move autaxys from a conceptual framework towards a formalized, predictive scientific theory, guided by the Autaxys Research Methodology (ARM, Section 7.0 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)) and supported by the Autologos Protocol (Section 8.0 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md)). The project numbering scheme is continuous. The ideas listed in Appendix 14.3 (in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)) serve as inspiration and specific targets for these projects. (Managed and documented in the AFKB, Section 7.8 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).
