**Outline for `AUTX-M1-Modeling_and_Table_Derivation_Strategy_v1.1.md`:**

1.  **Introduction: From Conceptual Framework to Computable Theory**
    1.1. Purpose: To outline the comprehensive, iterative strategy for computationally deriving the Autaxic Table of Patterns using the Autaxys Formal Mathematical Toolkit v2.0 (`D-P6.2-4`).
    1.2. The Autaxic Table as an Emergent Consequence: Reinforce that the Table is not postulated but is the *target output* of the generative dynamics.
    1.3. Addressing the Challenge of Formalization: Acknowledge the journey from the v1.9 Unified Framework to the v2.0 Toolkit and the role of critical self-analysis.

2.  **The Autaxic Generative Engine (AGE): Core Mechanics**
    2.1. Recap of the v2.0 Formal Toolkit: Briefly summarize the four levels (Attributed Graph, AQNs, Graph Rewriting, $L_A$ Optimization).
    2.2. The Local Optimization Loop as the Driver: Emphasize this as the core computational mechanism.
    2.3. The Nature of the Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A$): Discuss its role as embodying "Relational Aesthetics" and the "Economy of Existence" (e.g., $S/C$). Acknowledge the challenge in defining a universally applicable $L_A(G)$ and the strategy of starting with proxies (like in MVU-1).

3.  **Phase 1 Modeling: Minimal Viable Universes (MVUs) as Foundational Tests**
    3.1. **MVU-1 (`D-P6.2-5`): Single Timeline Pattern Emergence**
        3.1.1. Objective: Validate the emergence of basic stable patterns from minimal rules and proto-properties.
        3.1.2. Expected Output: First candidate $P_{ID}$s (e.g., bonded +/- pairs).
    3.2. **MVU-2 (Conceptual): Multiverse Census & Stability Landscape**
        3.2.1. Objective: Explore the statistical distribution of stable outcomes by running ensembles of MVU-1 class simulations with variations.
        3.2.2. Methodology: Parameter sweeps, stochastic variations.
        3.2.3. Introducing the "Exploration Drive": Discuss the rationale from `README.md (v9.0)` for needing more than just greedy optimization to achieve complex structure. Detail how this is tested in MVU-2.
        3.2.4. Expected Output: Identification of robustly emergent $P_{ID}$s; initial mapping of the $L_A$ landscape.

4.  **Iterative Strategy for Populating the Autaxic Table (Beyond MVU-1 & MVU-2)**
    4.1. **The Feedback Loop:**
        4.1.1. Run simulations (MVU-n).
        4.1.2. Identify emergent stable patterns ($P_{ID}$s).
        4.1.3. Compute their AQNs ($C, T, S, I_R$) using the methods defined in the Formal Toolkit.
        4.1.4. Compare with observed physical phenomena / existing particle tables.
        4.1.5. **Refine:** Based on discrepancies or successes, refine:
            4.1.5.1. The set of Proto-properties ($\Pi_D, \Pi_R$).
            4.1.5.2. The Graph Rewrite Rules ($\{r_i\}$).
            4.1.5.3. The definition of the Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A(G)$).
    4.2. **Scaling Complexity:**
        4.2.1. Incrementally add complexity to $\Pi$, $\{r_i\}$, and $L_A$.
        4.2.2. Introduce more sophisticated rule types (e.g., Merge, Split, Transformation, Adaptation, as per `AUTX-A0-Conceptual-AGE-Expansion-Speculations-V1.md`).
        4.2.3. Aim to reproduce known particle families and their interactions.
    4.3. **Deriving Interaction Rules ($I_R$):**
        4.3.1. $I_R$ are not fundamental rules but emerge from how stable $P_{ID}$s transform each other via the underlying Cosmic Algorithm ($\{r_i\}$).
        4.3.2. The modeling must show how observed forces (EM, Weak, Strong) can be derived as effective interaction patterns between specific $P_{ID}$s.

5.  **Addressing Challenges and Ensuring Rigor**
    5.1. **Computational Intractability:** Acknowledge the challenges (Kolmogorov Complexity, subgraph isomorphism) and discuss strategies (approximations, relative measures, heuristic pattern identification).
    5.2. **Defining "Stable Pattern":** Formalize the criteria for identifying a $P_{ID}$ from simulation output (persistence, recurrence, local $L_A$ optimality).
    5.3. **The Greedy Heuristic vs. Global Maximization:** Explicitly discuss the assumption that local $L_A$ maximization can lead to globally significant $A_A$ maximization, and how the "Exploration Drive" or future refinements might address this. Reference insights from the review document.
    5.4. **Falsifiability:** Reiterate how the framework remains falsifiable at each stage of modeling.

6.  **Connection to ANWOS and the "Shape of the Universe"**
    6.1. Briefly discuss how this bottom-up, generative modeling approach is an attempt to derive the universe's "shape" (its fundamental rules and constituents) from first principles, rather than inferring it from pre-existing patterns seen through ANWOS.
    6.2. The goal is to find the simplest generative "shape" (axioms, rules, $L_A$) that produces a pattern landscape matching observation.

7.  **Conclusion: Towards a Predictive, Generative Theory**
    7.1. Summarize the iterative modeling strategy as the path to constructing a predictive Autaxic Table and validating Autaxys as a scientific theory.
