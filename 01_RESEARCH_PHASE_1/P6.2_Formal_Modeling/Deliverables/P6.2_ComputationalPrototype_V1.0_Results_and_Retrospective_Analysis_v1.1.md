### **1.0 Summary of Findings (Computational Prototype v1.0)**

1.1.1 The computational experiment defined in the *Computational Prototype v1.0 Specification* (`D-P1-2.7.3.1`) was executed successfully using a self-contained Python script with no external dependencies. The experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that **transitivity emerges as a necessary condition for the stability (coherence) of composite relational patterns** under a simplified model of *Ontological Closure*.

1.1.2 The experiment yielded the following key results, confirming all initial hypotheses:
    1.1.2.1 **Primordial Act:** The *Asymmetric* pattern (`1 -> 2`) was correctly identified as the only minimal coherent pattern. The *Symmetric* pattern (`1 <-> 2`) was found to be unstable, as its structure implied the creation of self-loops (`1 -> 1`, `2 -> 2`) that were not present in the original graph when subjected to the defined self-application function $f(G)$.
    1.1.2.2 **Composite Instability:** A composite graph created by linking two stable patterns (`1 -> 2` and `2 -> 3`) was found to be incoherent (unstable). The model correctly identified that the structure implied a missing transitive link (`1 -> 3`) under the operation of $f(G)$.
    1.1.2.3 **Transitive Stability:** A modified version of the composite graph that included the transitive link (`1 -> 3`) was found to be coherent (stable), as its structure contained all of its own implications when processed by $f(G)$.

1.1.3 The success of this initial prototype provided the first piece of verifiable computational evidence for a core thesis of the Autaxys framework: that logical rules and necessary structural properties can be derived from a fundamental requirement of self-consistency, modeled as *Ontological Closure*.

### **2.0 Full, Verifiable Simulation Output (Computational Prototype v1.0)**

2.1.1 The following is the verbatim output from the execution of the dependency-free Python script for the v1.0 prototype.

```text
--- Executing Primordial Act ---

[?] Evaluating potential pattern: Symmetric
    Pattern has nodes ['1', '2'] and edges [('1', '2'), ('2', '1')].
[✗] FAILURE: Pattern 'Symmetric' is not coherent (unstable).
    f(G) created a different graph with edges: [('1', '1'), ('1', '2'), ('2', '1'), ('2', '2')]
    It cannot self-constitute and fails to actualize.

[?] Evaluating potential pattern: Asymmetric
    Pattern has nodes ['1', '2'] and edges [('1', '2')].
[✓] SUCCESS: Pattern 'Asymmetric' is coherent (is a stable fixed point).
    This pattern actualizes.


--- Starting Composition Experiment ---

[Step 1] Primordial Act successful. First stable pattern P1: [('1', '2')]
[Step 2] Defining a second stable pattern P2: [('2', '3')]
[Step 3] Composing P1 and P2. Composite graph has edges: [('1', '2'), ('2', '3')]
    Visual Representation: 1 -> 2 -> 3

[Step 4] Checking coherence of the composite graph...
[✓] HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED: The non-transitive composite graph is NOT coherent.
    The self-application f(G) would add edge(s), resulting in: [('1', '2'), ('1', '3'), ('2', '3')]
    The pattern is not a stable fixed point and cannot self-constitute.

[Step 5] Creating transitively closed graph. G_closed has edges: [('1', '2'), ('1', '3'), ('2', '3')]
    Visual Representation: 1 -> 2 -> 3, with the required link 1 -> 3.

[Step 6] Checking coherence of the transitively closed graph...
[✓] HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED: The transitively closed graph IS coherent.
    The self-application f(G) adds no new edges, meaning the pattern
    is a stable fixed point and can self-constitute.
```

### **3.0 Analysis & Implications (Computational Prototype v1.0)**

3.1.1 The successful execution of the v1.0 prototype confirmed the validity of its core hypothesis within its defined scope. The instability of the composite graph (`1->2`, `2->3`) demonstrated that a system of relations lacking transitivity is structurally incomplete and self-contradictory when subjected to the $f(G)$ transformation.
3.1.2 The $f(G)$ function, in this simple model, acted as an engine of logical closure, forcing the pattern to manifest the relationships implied by its existing structure. A pattern was only considered stable—and thus "actualized" as per the prototype's definition—when this process resulted in no further structural changes (i.e., it was a fixed point of $f(G)$).
3.1.3 The success of this proof-of-concept was a critical early milestone for the Autaxys program. It provided concrete, reproducible evidence that the principle of *Ontological Closure*, even in a highly simplified form, is computationally sound and can serve as a generative basis for deriving relational rules.

### **4.0 Retrospective Analysis: From Prototype v1.0 to the Autaxys v2.0 Formal Toolkit**

4.1.1 **Context of this Analysis:** This section provides a retrospective analysis of the Computational Prototype v1.0 (which tested emergent transitivity) in light of the significantly more advanced *Autaxys Formal Mathematical Toolkit v2.0* (`D-P6.2-4`) and the specification for the *Minimal Viable Universe (MVU-1)* (`D-P6.2-5`). The v1.0 prototype served as an essential early validation, and this analysis clarifies its role and limitations as a precursor to the current, more rigorous modeling efforts.

4.1.2 **Successes of the v1.0 Prototype within its Scope:**
    4.1.2.1 The v1.0 prototype successfully demonstrated that a minimal concept of *Ontological Closure* (defined as a stable fixed point under a simple transitive implication rule, $f(G)$) could lead to the emergence of a fundamental relational property (transitivity) as a necessary condition for structural self-consistency.
    4.1.2.2 It validated the core idea that relational rules might not need to be postulated ad hoc but could be derived from a deeper consistency principle.
    4.1.2.3 It confirmed the suitability of basic graph theory and computational modeling as viable tools for exploring Autaxys concepts, paving the way for more complex generative engines.

4.1.3 **Limitations of the v1.0 Prototype when Viewed from the v2.0 Formalism:** The transition to the v2.0 Formal Toolkit was necessitated by the inherent limitations of the v1.0 prototype's approach for achieving the broader goals of Autaxys:
    4.1.3.1 **Lack of Intrinsic Properties:** The v1.0 model utilized un-attributed nodes and generic relations. It entirely lacked the concept of *proto-properties* which are central to the v2.0 Formal Toolkit (Level 1 of `D-P6.2-4`). These proto-properties are essential for defining the "grammar" of interactions and for constraining the applicability of more diverse rules in a Graph Rewriting System.
    4.1.3.2 **Absence of Computable AQNs:** The prototype did not, and could not with its formalism, compute Autaxic Quantum Numbers ($C, T, S$). Its notion of "stability" was purely structural (a fixed point under $f(G)$), without a quantitative measure analogous to $S$ (Stability as attractor basin depth) or an assessment of intrinsic pattern Complexity $C$ (Kolmogorov Complexity).
    4.1.3.3 **Fixed, Singular "Rule":** The $f(G)$ transformation in the v1.0 prototype represented a single, hardcoded logical implication rule (transitive closure). The v2.0 framework replaces this with a flexible and extensible **Graph Rewriting System** (Level 3 of `D-P6.2-4`), where a set of multiple, diverse rules $\{r_i\}$ can exist, compete, and whose applicability is governed by matching attributed subgraphs (including proto-property constraints).
    4.1.3.4 **No Guiding Optimization Principle:** The v1.0 prototype's dynamics aimed for simple consistency (reaching a fixed point). It lacked the **Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A$)** and the associated **local optimization mechanism** (Level 4 of `D-P6.2-4`). In the v2.0 framework, this mechanism provides a dynamic driver for evolution towards states of higher "existential fitness" (maximized $L_A$), allowing for a richer exploration of the state space beyond mere logical closure. The v1.0 model simply iterated $f(G)$ until stable; it didn't "choose" between alternative evolutionary paths based on a quantitative quality metric.

4.1.4 **Significance as a Stepping Stone:**
    4.1.4.1 Despite its limitations when viewed retrospectively, the v1.0 prototype was crucial. Its success in demonstrating emergent transitivity provided the foundational confidence and initial empirical support necessary to invest in developing the more complex and comprehensive v2.0 Formal Toolkit.
    4.1.4.2 It clearly highlighted the need for:
        4.1.4.2.1 A richer representation of fundamental entities that includes intrinsic, constraining properties (leading to attributed graphs and proto-properties in v2.0).
        4.1.4.2.2 A more dynamic and flexible rule system capable of modeling diverse interactions (leading to Graph Rewriting Systems in v2.0).
        4.1.4.2.3 A quantifiable measure of "existential fitness" for graph states and a mechanism for selecting states based on this measure (leading to the Autaxic Lagrangian and the local optimization loop in v2.0).
    4.1.4.3 The v1.0 prototype effectively defined and tested the simplest possible case of achieving *Ontological Closure* through logical self-consistency. The v2.0 framework and the subsequent MVU-1 experiment now aim to explore how this core principle, when augmented with intrinsic properties and a more sophisticated dynamic driver ($L_A$ maximization), can generate a richer spectrum of stable patterns and emergent physical phenomena.

4.1.5 **Conclusion of Retrospective Analysis:** The Computational Prototype v1.0 successfully achieved its narrowly defined objective and served as an invaluable catalyst for the development of the significantly more powerful and comprehensive *Autaxys Formal Mathematical Toolkit v2.0*. Its results are consistent with the broader Autaxys philosophy but are now understood as representing a highly simplified special case of the richer generative dynamics proposed in the current v2.0 framework. The MVU-1 experiment, specified in `D-P6.2-5`, is the direct successor designed to test these more advanced principles.
