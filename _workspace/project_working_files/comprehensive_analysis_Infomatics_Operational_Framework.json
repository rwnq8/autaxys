      "summary": "This introduction to the *Infomatics Operational Framework* (v2.5) by Rowan Brad Quni critiques the limitations of standard physics (GR, SM, QM, dark sector) and the SI system, proposing that challenges stem from historical assumptions like *a priori* quantization and anthropocentric biases. It recaps Infomatics' foundational principles: reality as a continuous information field (I), manifestation as resonant patterns (Î) via resolution (ε), and governance by π-φ geometry. The document set details the transition to an operational framework, outlining how subsequent sections develop quantitative models for resonance structure, geometric constants (deriving G, Planck scales from π, φ), empirical validation, emergent interaction strength, gravity, cosmology without a dark sector, and reinterpreting quantum phenomena, aiming to establish Infomatics as a testable scientific framework.",

Crucially, the structure and dynamics of these patterns and interactions are governed by fundamental, abstract geometric principles represented by π and φ, which are considered ontologically primary. This framework departs significantly from classical and standard quantum paradigms by grounding reality in information, continuity, and intrinsic geometry.",

It highlights the framework's core principles based on a continuous informational substrate governed by geometric constants (π, φ) and emergent resonant states. The discussion evaluates Infomatics' strengths, including its drive towards greater parsimony compared to standard models (ΛCDM + SM) by aiming to derive constants and eliminate ad-hoc entities like Dark Matter and Dark Energy. It outlines the framework's predictive power, citing geometric origins of constants, φ-mass scaling predictions, and a cosmology without DM/DE. Finally, it details the necessary future work (Phase 3) focused on quantitative derivation and empirical validation.",

Building upon the structure established in Phase 2, the central goal is to transform the framework into a fully quantitative and predictive physical theory. The methodology details six key steps: formulating fundamental π-φ dynamic equations, deriving allowed (n, m) resonant states and their properties, determining interaction rules and the geometric transition amplitude F, performing quantitative calculations for particle physics and cosmology, comparing results with experimental data (including addressing DM/DE anomalies), and identifying unique predictions for future tests. Success in these steps is presented as crucial evidence for Infomatics as a viable fundamental theory.",

It shifts methodology from empirical correlations to geometric inference based on stable particles. A key finding is the strong empirical correlation between fundamental fermion stability levels (m) and the primality of Lucas numbers (L_m), leading to the L_m Primality Hypothesis. The report explores potential geometric, dynamic, and topological origins for this rule, concluding that a geometric/topological explanation within φ-based structures is the most promising path forward. The refined strategy focuses on deriving geometric stability rules, particularly for fermions based on the L_m hypothesis, and modeling bosons separately, before developing dynamics and calculating transition amplitudes.",

The documents outline the theoretical foundations, resonance structure, derivation of constants, empirical validation attempts (particle masses, spectra), emergent interaction strengths, gravity, cosmology, and a reinterpretation of the origin event and quantum phenomena, positioning Infomatics as a quantitative, testable framework.",
