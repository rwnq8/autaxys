### **1.0 Introduction**

1.1.1 This document establishes the formal mathematical and computational toolkit for the Autaxys framework. It translates the core concepts, previously described in the *Unified Framework* (`D-P6.7-1`), into a rigorous, testable, and computationally grounded structure. This v2.0 formalization serves as the operational blueprint for the Autaxic Generative Engine (AGE) and all subsequent modeling efforts.

### **2.0 Level 1: The Attributed Relational Graph**

2.1.1 The state of the universe at any discrete step is formally described using **Graph Theory**.

2.1.2 A universal state is an *attributed relational graph* $G$, defined as a 4-tuple:
> $$ G = (D, R, f_D, f_R) $$

2.1.3 The components of the tuple are defined as:
    2.1.3.1 **$D$**: A finite set of vertices, representing the fundamental **Distinctions**. Each $d \in D$ is a unique entity or node.
    2.1.3.2 **$R$**: A finite set of edges, representing the **Relations** between distinctions.
    2.1.3.3 **$f_D$**: A function that assigns a set of *proto-properties* to each distinction, $f_D: D \to \mathcal{P}(\Pi_D)$, where $\Pi_D$ is the space of all possible proto-properties for distinctions.
    2.1.3.4 **$f_R$**: A function that assigns a set of *proto-properties* to each relation, $f_R: R \to \mathcal{P}(\Pi_R)$, where $\Pi_R$ is the space of all possible proto-properties for relations.

2.1.4 These *proto-properties* are not passive labels but are active, intrinsic constraints that define the preconditions and postconditions for all interactions within the system.

### **3.0 Level 2: The Autaxic Quantum Numbers (AQNs) as Computable Invariants**

3.1.1 The observable properties of stable, emergent patterns ($P_{ID}$s) are not fundamental but are derived as computable quantities from the structure of their corresponding subgraphs, $G_{P_{ID}}$. These are the **Autaxic Quantum Numbers (AQNs)**.

3.1.2 **Complexity ($C$):** The AQN corresponding to mass and energy is formalized using concepts from **Algorithmic Information Theory**.
    3.1.2.1 The complexity of a pattern is its **Kolmogorov Complexity**, approximated as the minimal description length of its attributed subgraph within the system's own descriptive grammar (i.e., its rewrite rules).
    > $$ C(P_{ID}) \approx K(G_{P_{ID}}) $$
    3.1.2.2 **Implication:** Mass is a measure of a pattern's irreducible information content.

3.1.3 **Topology ($T$):** The AQN corresponding to charge, spin, and other quantum numbers is formalized using **Group Theory** and **Graph Invariants**.
    3.1.3.1 The topology of a pattern is the set of its structural and symmetry properties, including:
    > $$ T(P_{ID}) = \{ Aut(G_{P_{ID}}), \chi(G_{P_{ID}}), \beta(G_{P_{ID}}), ... \} $$
    3.1.3.2 **$Aut(G_{P_{ID}})$**: The **automorphism group** of the attributed subgraph, which captures the pattern's symmetries. Its structure and representations are hypothesized to define the pattern's charges and interaction types.
    3.1.3.3 **Other Invariants**: Other graph invariants, such as the chromatic number ($\chi$) or Betti numbers ($\beta$), describe additional topological properties that may map to quantum numbers like spin or parity.

3.1.4 **Stability ($S$):** The AQN corresponding to lifetime is formalized using concepts from **Dynamical Systems**.
    3.1.4.1 A stable pattern represents an **attractor basin** in the state space of all possible graph configurations.
    3.1.4.2 The stability of a pattern is proportional to the "depth" of this basin, defined as the minimum "escape energy" ($\Delta E_{OC}$) required to break the pattern's *ontological closure*.
    > $$ S(P_{ID}) \propto -\Delta E_{OC} $$
    3.1.4.3 **Implication:** A pattern's lifetime is a measure of its resilience to the dynamic transformations defined by the system's rules.

### **4.0 Level 3: The Relational Calculus as a Graph Rewriting System**

4.1.1 The dynamics of the universe—the evolution of the graph state $G$—are governed by the **Cosmic Algorithm**. This algorithm is formally modeled as a **Graph Rewriting System**.

4.1.2 The system is defined by a set of production rules, $\{r_i\}$, where each rule is a transformation of the form:
> $$ r_i : L_i \to R_i $$
4.1.3 **$L_i$**: The "left-hand side" is an attributed subgraph pattern that must be matched. The match is contingent on both the relational structure and the specific *proto-properties* of the nodes and edges.
4.1.4 **$R_i$**: The "right-hand side" is the replacement attributed subgraph, defining the resulting structure and *proto-properties* after the rule is applied.

### **5.0 Level 4: The Autaxic Action Principle**

5.1.1 The selection of which rule to apply from the set of all possible transformations is governed by a single, fundamental guiding principle. This is a variational principle analogous to the Principle of Least Action, but one of maximization.

5.1.2 **The Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A$):**
    5.1.2.1 We define the **Autaxic Lagrangian**, $L_A(G)$, as a computable function that maps any graph state $G$ to a single scalar value. This value quantifies the state's "existential fitness" or *relational aesthetics*.
    5.1.2.2 The primary candidate for the Lagrangian is the **Stability-to-Complexity Ratio**, which captures the *economy of existence*:
    > $$ L_A(G) \propto \frac{S_{total}(G)}{C_{total}(G)} $$
    where $S_{total}$ and $C_{total}$ are measures of the total stability and complexity of all patterns within the graph state $G$.

5.1.3 **The Autaxic Action Principle:**
    5.1.3.1 The evolution of the universe from an initial state $G_0$ to a final state $G_N$ follows a discrete path $(G_0, G_1, ..., G_N)$ that maximizes the total **Autaxic Action**, $A_A$.
    > $$ \text{Maximize } A_A = \sum_{t=0}^{N} L_A(G_t) $$

### **6.0 Synthesis: The Computational Loop**

6.1.1 The global Autaxic Action Principle is implemented via a **greedy local optimization mechanism**. This provides a plausible and computable engine for cosmic evolution.

6.1.2 The process for evolving the state from $G_t$ to $G_{t+1}$ is an iterative computational loop:
    6.1.2.1 **Identify:** Scan the current graph state $G_t$ to find all possible applications of all rules $\{r_i\}$ based on matching both structure and proto-property constraints.
    6.1.2.2 **Generate:** For each possible rule application, generate the potential next state $G'_{t+1}$.
    6.1.2.3 **Evaluate:** For each potential state $G'_{t+1}$, compute its Autaxic Lagrangian score, $L_A(G'_{t+1})$.
    6.1.2.4 **Select:** Identify the single potential state, $G''_{t+1}$, that yields the maximum $L_A$ score.
    > $$ G''_{t+1} = \underset{G' \in \{\text{potential futures}\}}{\text{argmax}} (L_A(G')) $$
    6.1.2.5 **Actualize:** The selected state becomes the new state of the universe: $G_{t+1} = G''_{t+1}$. The loop then repeats.
