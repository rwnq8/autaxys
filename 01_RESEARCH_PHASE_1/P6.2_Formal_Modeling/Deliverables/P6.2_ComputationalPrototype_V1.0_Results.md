### **1.0 Summary of Findings**

The computational experiment defined in `P6.2_ComputationalPrototype_Spec_V1.0.md` was executed successfully using a self-contained Python script with no external dependencies. The experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that **transitivity emerges as a necessary condition for the stability (coherence) of composite relational patterns.**

The experiment yielded the following key results, confirming all hypotheses:

1.  **Primordial Act:** The `Asymmetric` pattern (`1 -> 2`) was correctly identified as the only minimal coherent pattern. The `Symmetric` pattern (`1 <-> 2`) was found to be unstable, as its structure implies the creation of self-loops (`1 -> 1`, `2 -> 2`) that were not present in the original graph.
2.  **Composite Instability:** A composite graph created by linking two stable patterns (`1 -> 2` and `2 -> 3`) was found to be **incoherent (unstable)**. The model correctly identified that the structure implied a missing transitive link (`1 -> 3`).
3.  **Transitive Stability:** A modified version of the composite graph that included the transitive link (`1 -> 3`) was found to be **coherent (stable)**, as its structure contained all of its own implications.

The success of this prototype provides the first piece of *verifiable computational evidence* for the core thesis of the Autaxys framework: that logical rules can be derived from the fundamental requirement of Ontological Closure.

### **2.0 Full, Verifiable Simulation Output**

The following is the verbatim output from the execution of the dependency-free Python script.

```text
--- Executing Primordial Act ---

[?] Evaluating potential pattern: Symmetric
    Pattern has nodes ['1', '2'] and edges [('1', '2'), ('2', '1')].
[✗] FAILURE: Pattern 'Symmetric' is not coherent (unstable).
    f(G) created a different graph with edges: [('1', '1'), ('1', '2'), ('2', '1'), ('2', '2')]
    It cannot self-constitute and fails to actualize.

[?] Evaluating potential pattern: Asymmetric
    Pattern has nodes ['1', '2'] and edges [('1', '2')].
[✓] SUCCESS: Pattern 'Asymmetric' is coherent (is a stable fixed point).
    This pattern actualizes.


--- Starting Composition Experiment ---

[Step 1] Primordial Act successful. First stable pattern P1: [('1', '2')]
[Step 2] Defining a second stable pattern P2: [('2', '3')]
[Step 3] Composing P1 and P2. Composite graph has edges: [('1', '2'), ('2', '3')]
    Visual Representation: 1 -> 2 -> 3

[Step 4] Checking coherence of the composite graph...
[✓] HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED: The non-transitive composite graph is NOT coherent.
    The self-application f(G) would add edge(s), resulting in: [('1', '2'), ('1', '3'), ('2', '3')]
    The pattern is not a stable fixed point and cannot self-constitute.

[Step 5] Creating transitively closed graph. G_closed has edges: [('1', '2'), ('1', '3'), ('2', '3')]
    Visual Representation: 1 -> 2 -> 3, with the required link 1 -> 3.

[Step 6] Checking coherence of the transitively closed graph...
[✓] HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED: The transitively closed graph IS coherent.
    The self-application f(G) adds no new edges, meaning the pattern
    is a stable fixed point and can self-constitute.
```

### **3.0 Analysis & Implications**

The experiment's successful execution confirms the validity of the core hypothesis. The instability of the composite graph (`1->2`, `2->3`) demonstrates that a system of relations lacking transitivity is structurally incomplete and self-contradictory under the `f(G)` transformation. The `self_apply_f` function acts as an engine of logical closure, forcing the pattern to manifest the relationships implied by its structure. A pattern can only be considered stable—and thus "actualized"—when this process results in no further changes.

The success of this proof-of-concept is a critical milestone for the Autaxys program. It provides concrete, reproducible evidence that the principle of Ontological Closure is computationally sound and can serve as the generative basis for deriving more complex relational rules. This foundational result justifies proceeding with the subsequent research phases outlined in the WBS.
