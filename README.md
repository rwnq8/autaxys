# Autaxys Foundational Research

This repository contains the core documents, research outputs, and deliverables for the **Autaxys research program**. Autaxys is a proposed fundamental principle of reality, conceived as a self-ordering, self-arranging, and self-generating system. The field of Autology is dedicated to its systematic study, aiming to provide a more coherent, unified, and generative understanding of existence.

## What is Autaxys?

**Autaxys** is proposed as a fundamental principle of reality, defined as the intrinsic capacity for self-ordering, self-arranging, and self-generating patterned existence, operating without external agents or pre-imposed rules. It is the inherent dynamic process from which all discernible structures and phenomena, including matter, energy, spacetime, and physical laws, emerge as complex patterns. This concept shifts the understanding of reality from static "things" to dynamic processes and emergent patterns.

Current foundational scientific and philosophical ideas face considerable challenges in explaining the fundamental origin of order, the nature of physical laws, and how patterned reality comes into being from basic principles. Autaxys addresses these gaps by proposing that reality operates through an intrinsic "generative engine." This engine comprises:
*   **Core Operational Dynamics:** Relational Processing, Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Feedback Dynamics, Resonance, and Critical State Transitions.
*   **Intrinsic Meta-Logical Principles:** Intrinsic Coherence, Conservation of Distinguishability, Parsimony, Intrinsic Determinacy/Emergent Probabilism, and Interactive Complexity Maximization.

By moving from substance-based views to a process-pattern perspective rooted in this principle, Autaxys offers a "new way of seeing" reality, aiming for a more coherent and generative understanding of the universe.

**Autology** is the interdisciplinary field dedicated to the systematic study of autaxys and its manifestations. It aims to understand the core characteristics and intrinsic dynamics of autaxys, to elucidate general principles of pattern genesis and complexification, and to explore the epistemological and ontological implications of this framework.

## AI-Assisted Research with Autologos

This research program is conducted in close partnership with the **Autologos AI Process Manager**. Autologos is an advanced AI designed to accelerate foundational research through iterative, Φ-maximizing processes, managing complex workflows, and ensuring rigorous quality assurance.

A unique aspect of this collaboration is that the Autologos AI's operational process—its iterative refinement, convergence towards coherent solutions, and dynamic self-organization—serves as an **operational model of the Autaxys framework's self-organizing principles**. This direct analogy between the AI's internal workings and the reality it helps to model creates a powerful synergy, enhancing the research process itself.

For a comprehensive understanding of the AI-human collaboration methodology, including Autologos's operational principles, risk management strategies, and its own development cycle, please refer to the dedicated `Autologos-Autaxys_Integration_Protocol_v1.2.md` file located in the root of the main repository.
