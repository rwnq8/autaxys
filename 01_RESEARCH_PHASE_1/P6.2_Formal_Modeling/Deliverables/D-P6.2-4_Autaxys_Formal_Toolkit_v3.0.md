### **The Formal Hypothesis of Autaxys (v2.0)**

**Preamble:**
The Autaxys framework proposes a fundamental and radical shift in ontological perspective, moving from a universe conceived as being composed of elementary, independently existing "things" (particles, fields, strings, etc.) embedded within a pre-existing stage of absolute or relative spacetime, governed by immutable, pre-existing laws discovered through observation and encoded in mathematical equations, to one understood instead as a dynamic, self-organizing, self-consistent network of relations undergoing continuous computation. It seeks to provide a generative, first-principles explanation for the emergence of observed physical reality, including its intricate structure at all scales, its fundamental dynamics, the properties of its constituents, the nature of its forces, and even the fabric of spacetime itself, through a process of relational processing and emergent self-consistency, driven by a fundamental principle of maximizing "existential fitness" or "relational aesthetics" within a continuously evolving attributed graph structure. This framework posits that the universe's observed regularities, its fundamental particles, its fundamental forces, the emergent properties of spacetime, and the very "laws" that govern their behavior are not imposed externally or posited axiomatically as irreducible primitives but arise intrinsically and dynamically from the iterative transformations of this fundamental relational substrate, guided by a fundamental optimization principle. The Autaxys hypothesis is that a sufficiently simple, minimal, and well-defined set of initial principles governing this substrate and its dynamics – a specific "Autaxys Configuration" acting as a cosmic "seed" or "algorithm" – can computationally generate the complexity, specificity, and fine-tuning observed in the physical universe. This generative approach contrasts sharply with traditional descriptive or inferential approaches that seek to model reality by postulating fundamental entities and laws based on observed patterns (ANWOS). Autaxys aims instead to *derive* the observed patterns, the fundamental constituents, and the effective laws of physics *from* the generative principles, demonstrating *why* reality takes the specific form it does, rather than merely describing *what* it is or *how* it behaves according to pre-defined rules inferred from observation. It is a form of computational natural philosophy seeking the minimal generative principles, the simplest "source code," that produces the observed universe as a preferred, stable, and highly fit outcome of a fundamental computational process, akin to finding the simplest algorithm that compiles into the complex and specific universe we perceive. The transition from a high-level conceptual framework (v1.9) to a formal, rigorous, and computationally grounded theory (v2.0) is a critical step in making this hypothesis scientifically testable, amenable to large-scale computational simulation, and ultimately subject to empirical validation and potential falsification. This document formally defines the core postulates, derived concepts, and central hypothesis of this v2.0 framework, serving as the theoretical foundation and operational blueprint for all subsequent modeling and empirical validation efforts. It outlines the fundamental ontology (P1) based on an attributed relational graph, the fundamental dynamics (P2) as a graph rewriting system, the fundamental selection principle (P3) based on Autaxic Lagrangian optimization, and the nature of emergent phenomena (DC1-DC4) including patterns, their quantitative properties (AQNs), self-maintenance (Ontological Closure), and the drive towards complexity (Exploration Drive), culminating in the central hypothesis (H1) that links these fundamental principles to the generation and properties of observed physical reality (H1.1-H1.5). This framework represents a unified attempt to derive the entire spectrum of physical reality, from fundamental particles and forces to spacetime and cosmology, from a minimal set of generative axioms rooted in relational processing and emergent self-consistency guided by a principle of existential fitness. The philosophical implications of this generative, relational ontology are profound, challenging traditional notions of substance, locality, and the nature of physical law, suggesting that reality's essence lies not in static things or external rules, but in dynamic, attributed relationships and the computational process of their evolution towards preferred states of coherence and fitness.

**Core Postulates (Axioms of the System):**

1.  **P1 (Relational Substrate):** The fundamental substrate of reality at any discrete state $t$ is exhaustively and solely represented by a finite, dynamic **Attributed Relational Graph (ARG)**, denoted $G_t = (D_t, R_t, f_{D,t}, f_{R,t})$. The entire history and structure of the universe are constituted by the sequence of states $G_0, G_1, G_2, ..., G_t, G_{t+1}, ...$, where the evolution from $G_t$ to $G_{t+1}$ occurs over discrete, sequential time steps. The universe *is* this evolving graph; it is not embedded in any external, pre-existing space or time, nor does it exist upon a fundamental, pre-defined manifold. Instead, spatial relationships, temporal durations, causal connections, and geometric properties (like dimensionality and curvature) are not fundamental but rather *created*, *defined*, or *emerge* from the intrinsic structure and dynamics of the graph itself (H1.5). This relational ontology is fundamental, positing that existence, identity, and properties are defined solely by relationships and intrinsic potentials encoded as attributes, not by independent substance, inherent location, or pre-existing presence in an external arena. The graph is the sole container, descriptor, and constituent of reality at the most fundamental level. The specific properties and structure of the ARG formalism chosen (directed, multiset, attributed) are a deliberate hypothesis about the minimal necessary characteristics of this fundamental substrate to enable the emergence of observed reality. While acknowledging that reality might ultimately be better described by richer or alternative formalisms such as Attributed Hypergraphs (for representing fundamental multi-way relations or interactions beyond pairwise links), Attributed Simplicial Complexes (for capturing higher-order topological structures like triangles, tetrahedra, etc., that might be fundamental), Category-Theoretic Structures (where objects could be graph states, patterns, or types, and morphisms are rule applications or transformations, providing a framework for compositionality and structure-preserving mappings, potentially linking to abstract algebraic structures or higher-order processes), Process Calculi (modeling distinctions as dynamic processes with defined interaction protocols, emphasizing the computational and dynamic nature), Formal Languages/Grammars (viewing the GRS as a formal grammar generating the universe's historical trajectory in state space), or Abstract Algebraic Structures (defining operations and relationships on fundamental properties or rules, e.g., Lie algebras, Clifford algebras, Jordan algebras, quantum algebras, groupoids, which might provide a deeper foundation for emergent symmetries and quantum behavior), the Attributed Relational Graph is selected for v2.0 due to its balance of expressive power, intuitive representation, and computational tractability for initial modeling and simulation efforts (see 2.1.6 in D-P6.2-2 for a discussion of alternative formalisms). The ARG provides a flexible, non-manifold, non-metric structure at the fundamental level, from which spacetime and geometry are expected to emerge. The initial state $G_0$ from which the universe evolves is also a parameter of the configuration, representing the initial conditions of the fundamental substrate. The specific properties of $G_0$ (size, density, proto-property distribution, initial structure) are part of the configuration hypothesis and can influence the specific history generated, though robust configurations should ideally converge to similar emergent statistical properties.

    *   **$D_t$**: A finite set of unique, transient identifiers for **Distinctions** (nodes) existing at time $t$. $D_t \subset \mathbb{N}$, where the natural numbers serve merely as transient labels for distinct entities or potential 'points' of relation at a given time step. Distinctions are the primitive 'units' of individuation or difference within the substrate; they acquire identity solely through their participation in relations and their assigned proto-properties. They have no inherent spatial location, temporal duration, or inherent substance independent of the graph state. They are dimensionless points of differentiation or localized computational processes in the relational network, analogous to abstract points or events in a causal set, but crucially endowed with rich intrinsic properties and capable of forming complex, attributed relations. Their transience implies that distinctions can be created or destroyed by the dynamics (P2), reflecting potential changes in the fundamental granularity or degrees of freedom of the substrate, potentially relating to particle creation/annihilation events in emergent physics or phase transitions in the fundamental structure of reality. The size of the set $|D_t|$ can grow or shrink over time, representing changes in the fundamental degrees of freedom of the system, potentially driven by the $L_A$ optimization (P3). The uniqueness of identifiers is only necessary for tracking and computation at a given step; their fundamental, persistent identity is relationally defined by their stable involvement in recurrent emergent patterns ($P_{ID}$s, DC1) and their characteristic, statistically derived AQNs (DC2), analogous to how particles are identified by their properties and interactions.

    *   **$R_t$**: A finite multiset of directed **Relations** (edges) between distinctions at time $t$. $R_t \subset D_t \times D_t \times \mathbb{N}$, where $(u, v, k)$ signifies the $k$-th distinct relation instance of a potentially specified type from distinction $u$ to distinction $v$. $u, v \in D_t$. Relations define the instantaneous structure, connections, dependencies, and instantaneous influence pathways between distinctions. They establish a network topology that is not embedded in a pre-existing space but *constitutes* the substrate's relational structure. Relations are the 'bonds', 'interactions', 'information channels', 'dependencies', 'correlations', or 'causal links' between distinctions. They are the dynamic connections that weave the distinctions into a coherent structure. The use of a multiset allows for multiple distinct relations of the same source, target, and even type or properties between the same pair of distinctions, potentially representing different interaction channels, parallel connections, different aspects of a composite interaction, or even different emergent forces acting between the same entities simultaneously. For instance, two distinctions could be linked by a "strong bond" relation and a "weak influence" relation concurrently. This multiset capability adds significant expressive power, allowing for richer and more nuanced interactions and states than simple graphs, potentially modeling phenomena like multiple force carriers between particles, different types of quantum correlations, layered dependencies in complex systems, or different interaction channels (e.g., electromagnetic vs. strong interaction between two particles). The directed nature is fundamental for modeling causality, information flow, asymmetric dependencies, directed processes, or gradients, potentially giving rise to an emergent causal structure (H1.5) and an arrow of time (H1.1, H1.5). Relations themselves are first-class entities in the ontology, not just abstract links; they possess properties, can be created, destroyed, and transformed by the dynamics (P2), and play an active role in shaping the system's evolution by enabling or constraining rule applications and influencing $L_A$. The multiset nature could also potentially model emergent field excitations, where a set of relation instances between regions represents a distributed field state or flux. Relations are the carriers of connection and influence in the system.

    *   **$f_{D,t}$**: An attribute function assigning a set of intrinsic **Proto-properties** to each distinction in $D_t$. $f_{D,t}: D_t \to \mathcal{P}(\Pi_D)$. $\Pi_D$ is a universal, finite set of all possible *types* of proto-properties for distinctions. $\Pi_D = \{\pi_{D,1}, \pi_{D,2}, ..., \pi_{D,m}\}$. Proto-properties are not passive labels but represent active potentials, constraints, internal states, computational flags, inherent capabilities, or affordances that dictate how a distinction can participate in relations and transformations. They are the fundamental qualitative 'alphabet' or 'feature set' of the substrate, analogous to fundamental charges, internal quantum numbers, or computational states in physics but at a more primitive, pre-geometric, pre-spacetime level. The specific set of proto-properties assigned to a distinction instance ($f_{D,t}(d) \subseteq \Pi_D$) defines its instantaneous qualitative nature, its role in the network, and its potential for interaction. Examples of proto-property types: Abstract 'polarities' (e.g., $\sigma_+, \sigma_-, \sigma_0$, potentially forming a group or algebraic structure under combination, like $\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$ analogues, where specific combinations might be favored or forbidden by rules or $L_A$), 'valence limits' (e.g., maximum allowed incoming/outgoing relations of specific types or properties, potentially analogous to valency in chemistry or bond saturation in molecular structures, constraining connectivity), 'interaction types' (e.g., $\iota_A, \iota_B, \iota_C$, specifying which kinds of rules or relations a distinction can be involved in, acting as primitive interaction channels), 'identity markers' (e.g., $\delta_1, \delta_2, ...$, potentially related to emergent particle families or types, or defining distinct classes of distinctions that behave differently), 'state indicators' (e.g., $\xi_{active}, \xi_{inert}, \xi_{excited}, \xi_{processing}$, representing internal states that affect behavior, rule applicability, or influence on $L_A$), 'computational flags' (e.g., $\phi_{processing}, \phi_{waiting}$, related to the substrate being viewed as a computation), 'binding potentials' (e.g., $\beta_{bind}$, indicating a propensity to form stable bonds or patterns, influencing $L_A$), 'topological potentials' (e.g., $\tau_{cycle}, \tau_{path}$, indicating a propensity to form or participate in certain topological structures like cycles or paths, influencing $L_A$), 'information capacity' (e.g., $I_c$, representing how much 'state' or 'information' a distinction can hold, potentially relevant for emergent quantum phenomena or complexity), 'color charges' (e.g., $c_r, c_g, c_b$, potentially forming representations of abstract $SU(3)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_3$ algebraic structures, with specific combination rules required for rule application or favored by $L_A$), 'weak isospin states' (e.g., $w_+, w_-$, potentially forming representations of abstract $SU(2)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ structures), 'flavor types' (e.g., $f_u, f_d$, representing qualitative distinctions that affect interaction types or stabilities), 'quantum state potential' (e.g., $\psi_{coherent}, \psi_{entangled}$, indicating a propensity to participate in emergent quantum phenomena like superposition or entanglement, potentially influencing the probabilistic selection process or $L_A$ terms), 'relativistic potential' (e.g., $\gamma_{fast}, \gamma_{slow}$, indicating propensity to move/interact in ways that give rise to relativistic effects in emergent spacetime). The specific universal set $\Pi_D$, the rigorous semantics of its proto-properties (i.e., how their presence or absence constrains rule applicability, influences $L_A$, determines transformation outcomes, and potentially participates in algebraic structures or state machines), and their initial distribution in $G_0$ are fixed for a given "Universe Seed" or Autaxys Configuration. The structure of $\Pi_D$ itself (e.g., whether properties are orthogonal, hierarchical, form a lattice, a group representation space, an algebraic structure like a field or ring, a category, a specific computational state machine with defined transitions and states, or elements of a non-commutative algebra like a Clifford algebra or Jordan algebra) is a critical part of the configuration definition; for instance, proto-properties could form representations of abstract algebraic structures (e.g., Lie algebras, Clifford algebras, Jordan algebras), and rule applications might require compatibility with these structures (e.g., conservation of 'property sums' based on group operations, compatibility of states in a state machine model, or specific commutation relations related to non-commutative algebras). The semantics of proto-properties are critical; they define the "meaning" or "behavioral potential" of distinctions in terms of their dynamic potential and interaction capabilities, essentially providing a primitive "type system," "state space," or "algebraic foundation" for the fundamental units, enabling differentiation and selective interaction. Proto-properties can also be viewed as defining the internal degrees of freedom of distinctions, analogous to internal quantum states. The definition of proto-properties is a key component of the Autaxys configuration hypothesis, encoding the fundamental qualities and their rules of combination and interaction. The set of proto-properties defines the "alphabet" of existence.

    *   **$f_{R,t}$**: An attribute function assigning a set of intrinsic **Proto-properties** to each relation in $R_t$. $f_{R,t}: R_t \to \mathcal{P}(\Pi_R)$. $\Pi_R$ is a universal, finite set of all possible *types* of proto-properties for relations. $\Pi_R = \{\pi_{R,1}, \pi_{R,2}, ..., \pi_{R,p}\}$. These govern the 'type', 'strength', 'directionality constraints', 'mediating potential', 'information capacity', 'causal nature', 'temporal ordering potential', 'spatial analogue properties', or 'contextual role' of a relation instance, influencing which rules can apply to it, the effects of rule application involving it, and how it affects the relational context of connected distinctions. Examples: 'binding strength levels' ($\beta_1, \beta_2, ...$, potentially quantizing the 'strength' of a bond, influencing $L_A$ or rule application probabilities), 'information flow potential' ($\phi_I$, relating to emergent causal structure or communication speed), 'relation categories' ($\rho_X, \rho_Y, \rho_Z$, representing different interaction channels or types of connection, e.g., 'strong link', 'weak link', 'electromagnetic link', potentially mediating different emergent forces), 'temporal ordering potential' ($\tau_{precede}, \tau_{follow}$, indicating a potential for establishing temporal order between connected events/distinctions, contributing to emergent causality and time), 'spatial analogue properties' ($\chi_{proximity}, \chi_{distance}$, representing degrees of relational 'nearness' or 'farness' not necessarily tied to a metric geometry but rather to interaction potential or influence propagation, or measures of "relational distance" in an abstract sense, potentially related to emergent spacetime metric or distance function), 'interaction channel identifiers' ($\alpha_1, \alpha_2$, potentially analogous to different force carriers or interaction types, e.g., 'strong channel', 'weak channel', 'electromagnetic channel'), 'causal type' ($\kappa_{strong}, \kappa_{weak}, \kappa_{potential}$, influencing the emergent causal structure), 'mediator flags' (e.g., $\mu_{forceA}, \mu_{forceB}$ indicating the relation can mediate a specific type of interaction, potentially linking to emergent force carriers or field quanta, where the relation instance *is* the mediator instance), 'topological significance' ($\tau_{cycle\_element}, \tau_{boundary}$, indicating if a relation is part of a cycle or boundary structure, influencing $L_A$ or rule applicability), 'coherence potential' ($\gamma_{cohere}$, indicating a propensity to form stable patterns, influencing $L_A$), 'information content' (e.g., carrying a specific value or state, potentially analogous to flux, field strength, or information transfer, potentially quantifiable using information theory measures), 'quantum correlation indicator' (e.g., $\psi_{entangling}, \psi_{correlated}$, indicating a relation contributes to emergent non-local correlations, potentially influencing $L_A$ quantum terms or probabilistic selection), 'metric contribution' (e.g., $\eta_1, \eta_2$, indicating a relation contributes to building emergent spatial distance or curvature). Relations are not merely structural links but are also attributed entities capable of carrying information, state, or mediating specific types of interactions. They can act as channels for influence or as proxies for fields or forces. The specific universal set $\Pi_R$, the rigorous semantics of its proto-properties (including potential algebraic composition rules, ordering, or compatibility constraints, and their influence on rule application and $L_A$), and their initial distribution in $G_0$ are also fixed for a given Autaxys Configuration. Similar to $\Pi_D$, the structure and semantics of $\Pi_R$ are part of the configuration; for instance, relation properties could define an ordering or partial order on relations, or have composition rules under rule application that determine resulting relation properties, potentially forming algebraic structures themselves (e.g., composing relations A->B with property $p_1$ and B->C with property $p_2$ via a rule might create A->C with property $p_3 = p_1 \circ p_2$ under some defined operation $\circ$). The definition of relation proto-properties is another key component of the Autaxys configuration hypothesis, encoding the fundamental types of connections and their inherent qualities and dynamics. These properties define the "alphabet" of connections. Proto-properties can also be viewed as internal states or degrees of freedom of relations.

    *   The initial graph state $G_0$ (which could be minimal, e.g., an empty graph, a few distinctions with random properties, or could represent a highly ordered initial state, or even a state generated by a separate "pre-cosmic" process, potentially related to an initial state favored by a 'pre-cosmic' $L_A$ or meta-rule), the universal sets $\Pi_D, \Pi_R$ with their defined algebraic structures and semantic constraints, the finite set of attributed graph rewrite rules $\mathcal{R}$ (including any context dependencies or rule-specific parameters), and the computable function $L_A$ with its parameters, functional form, and any associated stochastic/exploration mechanisms (DC4) collectively define a specific Autaxys Configuration or "Universe Seed." Discovering the minimal, most parsimonious configuration that robustly generates patterns quantitatively and qualitatively matching observed reality is a core scientific goal of the Autaxys program (H1, 5.2 in AUTX-M1). The initial state $G_0$ is also a parameter, potentially influencing the specific history generated by a configuration, though robust configurations should ideally lead to similar emergent patterns and statistical properties regardless of simple $G_0$ variations, suggesting convergence to a dominant attractor basin or ensemble distribution. The space of all possible Autaxys Configurations is the space of all possible fundamental generative principles, and finding the one that matches our universe is the Grand Challenge, analogous to finding the correct set of fundamental laws and constants in traditional physics, but here, they are the rules and fitness function of a generative process operating on a relational substrate. The configuration itself can be seen as the "program" being executed to generate reality (4.3 in AUTX-P1.0-ANWOS). The goal is to find the simplest such program that compiles into the observed universe (5.2 in AUTX-M1). The size of the configuration space is vast, emphasizing the need for efficient search strategies (see AUTX-M1). The initial distribution of proto-properties in $G_0$ is also part of the configuration, representing the initial conditions of the fundamental substrate. The definition of this configuration space is a key component of the theoretical framework.

2.  **P2 (Dynamic Evolution via Rule Application):** The state of the graph evolves over discrete, sequential time steps $t \to t+1$ via the application of precisely one instance of a rule selected from a finite, fixed set, the **Cosmic Algorithm ($\mathcal{R} = \{r_i\}$)**. The Cosmic Algorithm is the fundamental generative grammar of the universe, defining all possible local and potentially global, property-constrained transformations of the relational substrate. It is a set of attributed graph rewrite rules. The discrete nature of time steps is a fundamental postulate, implying that change occurs in quantized steps, which may relate to fundamental temporal discreteness or the operational definition of a "moment" as a unit of transformation, potentially linking to Planck time in emergent spacetime (H1.5). This discreteness also simplifies computational simulation and provides a natural framework for a step-by-step generative process. This postulate defines the fundamental granularity of change in the system, the elementary "event" of the universe's evolution. Each step corresponds to the application of a single selected rule instance, chosen from the set of all possible applications according to the Autaxic Action Principle (P3). This process defines the flow of time as a sequence of discrete transformations.
    *   Each rule $r_i \in \mathcal{R}$ is a directed **Attributed Graph Rewrite Rule** of the form $L_i \Rightarrow R_i$. $L_i$ (the left-hand side) and $R_i$ (the right-hand side) are small, connected, attributed relational graphs, typically with designated 'interface' nodes/edges that specify how the rule connects to the surrounding context of the larger graph $G_t$ during application. The rule explicitly defines a mapping between elements (nodes and edges) of $L_i$ and $R_i$, specifying which elements are preserved, deleted, created, and how their proto-properties are transformed upon application. Rule application generally follows algebraic graph rewriting semantics, like the Double Pushout (DPO) or Single Pushout (SPO) approach, extended to handle attributed graphs and multisets. DPO semantics requires a "context" graph $K$ (the part of $G_t$ not matched by $L_i$) and ensures that elements in $L_i$ that are connected to the context $K$ are preserved in $R_i$ via the interface mapping, ensuring coherent integration of the rewritten part into the global graph. SPO is simpler, directly replacing $L_i$ with $R_i$ based on the mapping and potentially requiring explicit rules for connecting $R_i$ to the context. The specific choice of semantics (DPO vs. SPO vs. other variants like sesqui-pushout or hyperedge replacement, or even more complex rule types like nested graph rewriting or rules operating on specific algebraic structures of properties) impacts how rules interact with their context and is part of the configuration definition. Rules can be categorized by their primary effect on graph structure and attributes, reflecting the fundamental types of processes possible in the substrate:
        *   **Creation rules:** Primarily add new nodes, edges, or proto-properties, increasing the degrees of freedom or complexity locally. E.g., a rule that creates a new distinction with specific properties and relations to existing nodes if certain property and structural conditions are met in its vicinity. This is how the system can grow and introduce new fundamental entities or relations. A rule could create a new distinction with properties $(\pi_+, \iota_A)$ linked by a $\rho_b$ relation to an existing distinction with property $\pi_-$, contingent on the existing distinction having low valence or being in a specific state. These rules are essential for increasing the complexity and scale of the graph.
        *   **Deletion rules:** Primarily remove existing nodes, edges, or proto-properties, decreasing the degrees of freedom or simplifying structures locally. E.g., a rule that removes a relation or a distinction if it meets certain criteria (e.g., isolated node, low $L_A$ contribution, property configuration indicates instability, or if part of a structure that violates constraints). A rule could remove a relation of type $\rho_b$ between two distinctions with properties $(\pi_+, \pi_+)$ if such a relation is unstable or contributes negatively to $L_A$. A rule could remove a distinction with property $\xi_{inert}$ if it has no relations for a certain duration. These rules are necessary for modeling decay, annihilation, or simplification processes and managing computational resources (nodes/edges).
        *   **Transformation rules:** Primarily modify the proto-properties of existing nodes or edges without changing connectivity or existence, potentially changing their interaction potential, state, or emergent properties. E.g., a rule that flips a 'polarity' proto-property on a distinction from $\pi_+$ to $\pi_-$ if it's connected to another distinction with a specific property via a certain relation type and satisfies a context condition. A rule could change a relation's 'strength' property from $\beta_1$ to $\beta_2$ based on the state indicators of the connected distinctions. A rule could change a distinction's color property from $c_r$ to $c_g$ if it interacts with a pattern exhibiting specific algebraic properties. These rules model state changes or internal dynamics of distinctions/relations, analogous to internal transitions or state changes in particles (e.g., flavor oscillations, state changes due to field interactions, excitation/de-excitation). The transformation of proto-properties is a critical part of the rule definition, specifying how the qualitative nature of entities changes upon interaction, potentially analogous to particle transformations or state changes. The transformation process can also involve complex algebraic operations on proto-properties, determined by the rules and the structure of $\Pi_D, \Pi_R$, encoding conservation laws. Rules can also specify probabilistic outcomes for property transformations based on context or current properties, potentially modeling quantum superposition or state collapse.
        *   **Structural rules:** Primarily rearrange connectivity (e.g., edge contraction, node splitting, path substitution, cycle formation/breaking, merging/splitting subgraphs, adding/removing bridges, changing graph density locally, re-wiring connections based on properties or distance) without necessarily adding/removing many elements or changing many properties. E.g., a rule that replaces a path of relations A->B, B->C with a single A->C relation with properties derived from A and C properties and the intermediate relation properties (potentially linking to emergent transitivity or signal propagation). A rule could split a distinction into two distinctions, distributing its properties and connections, potentially analogous to particle decay or fission. A rule could merge two distinctions into one under specific conditions (e.g., high binding strength, complementary properties), analogous to particle fusion. Rules that re-wire connections can lead to changes in relational distance, affecting emergent spatial properties. These rules modify the network topology directly, shaping the structure from which spacetime emerges. Rules could also create non-local connections or correlations between distant parts of the graph, potentially modeling entanglement or wormholes.
        *   **Composite rules:** Combine multiple effects from the above categories in a single transformation. A rule could delete a distinction and its relations, create two new distinctions with different properties, and add new relations between them and the surrounding context, analogous to a decay process where one particle transforms into multiple others.
        Rules can also be context-dependent, requiring the presence or absence of certain structures, proto-properties, or even global graph properties in the vicinity of the match or elsewhere in the graph for applicability (negative application conditions - NACs, positive application conditions - PACs, global application conditions - GACs). Context conditions can range from simple checks on neighboring nodes/edges/properties to complex requirements on the local or global graph structure (e.g., requiring the match to be part of a cycle of a certain type, or to be in a region of high/low density, or to be connected to a specific global pattern instance, or to be in a region with specific emergent spacetime properties like local curvature or time rate) or even the historical trajectory (e.g., rule only applicable if a certain event happened recently, or if the local $L_A$ is below a threshold, or if the emergent spacetime curvature in the region is below/above a value, or if the local pattern diversity is low). The structure of $L_i$ and $R_i$, the mapping between them, and any context conditions define the specific local causality and transformation potential of the rule instance. Rules represent the "micro-actions" possible within the substrate, the pre-geometry, pre-physics operations from which observed dynamics emerge. They are the fundamental interactions at the most primitive level, defining the allowed state transitions of the fundamental substrate. The set $\mathcal{R}$ itself, its size, and the complexity of its rules are parameters of the Autaxys Configuration. The design of $\mathcal{R}$ is a critical part of the configuration hypothesis, encoding the fundamental "grammar" of change and the potential complexity of interactions. The rules encode the "laws" of how the substrate transforms itself. They define the "transition probabilities" or "allowed transitions" between different microstates, constrained by proto-properties and context. The rule set can be interpreted as the "instruction set" of the Cosmic Algorithm, defining the fundamental computational steps. The formal properties of the GRS defined by $\mathcal{R}$ (e.g., its generative capacity - what kinds of graphs can be generated; decidability of properties of generated graphs; confluence - does the order of rule application matter if multiple are applicable; termination properties - does the system halts; complexity class of recognition problems - how hard is it to find matches) are inherent theoretical properties of the configuration that may relate to fundamental limits or properties of the universe (e.g., if the GRS is Turing complete, the universe is a universal computer; if it's confluent, the order of non-overlapping local events doesn't matter for the final state; if it doesn't terminate, the universe continues to evolve). Rules can also include algebraic operations on proto-properties as part of the transformation, ensuring compatibility with the defined algebraic structure of $\Pi_D, \Pi_R$, potentially encoding conservation laws. Rules could also be conditional on the *absence* of a match for another rule or pattern (negative application conditions), which is powerful but computationally expensive.

    *   **Applicability**: A rule $r_i$ is applicable to the current graph $G_t$ if there exists at least one valid occurrence (a valid subgraph match) of $L_i$ within $G_t$. A match is an injective mapping $\mu: L_i \to G_t$ that preserves the graph structure (nodes, edges, directedness, multiset nature of edges) and satisfies all specified proto-property constraints defined for the rule $r_i$. Proto-property matching can involve complex boolean logic, value comparisons, set operations (e.g., requiring the set of properties of a node in $G_t$ to be a superset of the required properties in $L_i$, or requiring specific property values to be present/absent), algebraic compatibility checks (if properties have algebraic structure, e.g., requiring that $f_{D,t}(\mu(v))$ contains properties that form a specific representation of a group that $f_{L_i,D}(v)$ belongs to, or that a sum/product of properties over the matched subgraph satisfies a condition, potentially encoding conservation laws or compatibility rules), or even pattern matching on sets of properties, defined rigorously for each rule. The rule may also specify constraints on properties *not* present in $L_i$ but required in the context of $\mu(L_i)$ in $G_t$ (negative application conditions - NACs), or require specific global conditions on $G_t$ (e.g., total number of nodes, average degree, presence of specific global patterns, or global $L_A$ thresholds, or conditions related to emergent spacetime properties like local curvature or time rate, or conditions related to the system's history like total elapsed steps or total $L_A$ accumulated). Let $\mathcal{M}(G_t, r_i)$ be the set of all valid structural and property-constrained matches of $L_i$ in $G_t$. Let $\mathcal{M}(G_t) = \{ (r_i, \mu) \mid r_i \in \mathcal{R}, \mu \in \mathcal{M}(G_t, r_i) \}$ be the finite set of all possible rule application instances (rule-match pairs) available in $G_t$. If $\mathcal{M}(G_t)$ is empty, the system halts in a terminal state where no further evolution is possible under the given rule set. The computational challenge of finding $\mathcal{M}(G_t)$ involves potentially solving multiple instances of the NP-complete subgraph isomorphism problem, complicated by attribute matching, complex context constraints (local and global), and the potentially large and dynamic size of $G_t$. Efficient algorithms, indexing structures, heuristic pruning, and potentially machine learning approaches (e.g., GNNs trained to predict rule applicability or find matches) are critical for practical simulation (see AUTX-M1). The number of possible matches can be vast, representing a branching tree of potential futures at each step. Rule application can also be non-deterministic even given a match, e.g., a rule could have a probabilistic outcome (transforming $L_i$ into one of several possible $R_i$ sides with specified probabilities defined by attributes or context) or a choice between several $R_i$ sides depending on properties or context, adding another layer of potential stochasticity beyond $L_A$-based selection. This inherent rule-based non-determinism, combined with $L_A$-based probabilistic selection (P3/DC4), provides potential computational mechanisms for the origin of quantum probability. Rules can also be prioritized or weighted based on their properties, context, or recent application history, influencing the selection process (P3).

    *   **Transformation**: Applying rule $r_i$ at a specific match $\mu \in \mathcal{M}(G_t, r_i)$ transforms $G_t$ into a potential immediate successor state $G'_{t+1}$. This transformation is performed according to the rule's mapping, typically following a double pushout (DPO) or single pushout (SPO) semantics from algebraic graph rewriting theory, extended to attributed graphs and handling the multiset nature of edges. The subgraph matched by $\mu(L_i)$ is conceptually removed (or elements are identified for preservation/transformation), and the graph $R_i$ is inserted, with connections to the remaining context of $G_t$ established as specified by the rule's interface mapping. This process can add/remove nodes/edges and change proto-property assignments of elements within the matched $\mu(L_i)$ that map to $R_i$, or even elements in the context based on rule specifications. The transformation must preserve global invariants or satisfy post-conditions specified by the rule or the configuration (e.g., conservation of specific proto-property sums if defined by the underlying algebraic structure of $\Pi_D, \Pi_R$ and the rules, or conservation of topological invariants like cycle counts or Betti numbers, or conservation of total $L_A$ contribution from specific pattern types if the rule is designed to model a specific interaction). Let $\mathcal{A}(G_t, r_i, \mu)$ denote the unique graph state resulting from applying rule $r_i$ via match $\mu$ in $G_t$. Rules can also specify the creation of new, non-local relations or correlations between distant parts of the graph, which is important for modeling entanglement or field propagation. Rules can also specify the creation of new proto-properties on existing or new elements, or the removal of properties. The transformation of proto-properties is a critical part of the rule definition, specifying how the qualitative nature of entities changes upon interaction, potentially analogous to particle transformations or state changes. The transformation process can also involve complex algebraic operations on proto-properties, determined by the rules and the structure of $\Pi_D, \Pi_R$.

    *   Let $\mathcal{P}(G_t) = \{ \mathcal{A}(G_t, r_i, \mu) \mid (r_i, \mu) \in \mathcal{M}(G_t) \}$ be the finite set of all possible immediate successor graph states reachable from $G_t$ by applying exactly one rule instance. The size of $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$ can be very large, equal to $|\mathcal{M}(G_t)|$. The selection of which one of these potential futures is actualized is governed by P3. The potential for multiple simultaneous rule applications across spatially or relationally separated regions of the graph could be modeled as parallel processes in the underlying substrate, whose collective outcome is then evaluated by $L_A$, or could be incorporated into the selection principle (P3) where the 'optimal' state is the one achievable by the most $L_A$-boosting *set* of non-conflicting rule applications in a single time step (complex multi-step optimization). However, for v2.0, the postulate is a single rule application per discrete step for simplicity and computational tractability, defining the most granular unit of cosmic change and providing a clear temporal ordering. Future versions might explore parallel rule application semantics, multi-step lookahead in the optimization, or modeling synchronous vs. asynchronous rule application. The computational process of finding $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$ involves generating these potential states efficiently.

3.  **P3 (The Autaxic Action Principle & Local Optimization):** The selection of the unique state transition from $G_t$ to $G_{t+1}$ at each discrete time step is governed by a single, fundamental guiding principle. This is a variational principle analogous to the Principle of Least Action, but one of maximization, or a probabilistic sampling of the fitness landscape. This principle provides the "telos" or directedness to the cosmic evolution, acting as a fundamental selection pressure on the possible transformations defined by the Cosmic Algorithm. It embodies the fundamental drive towards increasing structure, organization, and complexity, counteracting simple entropic decay.
    *   **The Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A$):** There exists a universal, computable function $L_A: \text{AttributedGraphs} \to \mathbb{R}$ that maps any valid attributed relational graph state $G$ to a single scalar value (P3 in `D-P6.2-4`). This value quantifies the state's "Relational Aesthetics," "existential fitness," intrinsic "coherence," "organization," "potential for sustained, complex existence," or "thermodynamic viability" within the Autaxys framework. It embodies the *Economy of Existence*, favoring states that exhibit robust, organized structure, efficient relational processing, high information content relative to their underlying resource cost, and potentially the capacity for further complex evolution or adaptability. $L_A(G)$ is a flexible function that can include diverse terms reflecting various desirable properties of a graph state hypothesized to contribute to its "fitness." The specific functional form and parameters of $L_A$ are part of the Autaxys Configuration. Defining an $L_A$ that generates physical reality is a central scientific challenge, requiring a balance between favoring stable structure (exploitation) and favoring conditions that lead to discovering more complex structures (exploration). The structure of $L_A(G)$ can be hierarchical, aggregating contributions from local patterns, regional properties, and global metrics, and can include non-linear interactions between terms or threshold effects. $L_A$ calculation requires real-time or near-real-time pattern identification (DC1), AQN computation (DC2), and global metric calculation within the potential successor state $G'$. The computational efficiency of $L_A$ evaluation is a major challenge, potentially involving NP-hard problems like subgraph isomorphism for pattern matching and complex graph analyses.
        > $$ L_A(G) = F \left( \Lambda_{patterns}(G), \Lambda_{global}(G), \Lambda_{exploration}(G), \Lambda_{constraints}(G), \Lambda_{spacetime}(G), \Lambda_{quantum}(G), \Lambda_{algebraic}(G), \Lambda_{thermodynamic}(G), \Lambda_{computational}(G) \right) $$
        where these components are functions aggregating diverse metrics:
        *   $\Lambda_{patterns}(G)$: Aggregates contributions from identified instances of distinct $P_{ID}$ types currently present in $G$. This term favors states containing a high total "fitness contribution" from stable, complex patterns. The identification of pattern instances requires computationally identifying recurrent attributed subgraphs (DC1).
            > $$ \Lambda_{patterns}(G) = \sum_{P_{ID}_k \in \text{Pattern Types}} \sum_{p \in \text{Instances}(P_{ID}_k, G)} w_k \cdot \text{PatternTerm}(p, G, \{r_i\}) $$
            where $\text{Instances}(P_{ID}_k, G)$ is the set of all subgraph instances of pattern type $k$ identified in graph $G$ using the criteria defined in DC1. $\text{PatternTerm}(p, G, \{r_i\})$ is a function of the pattern instance's computationally derived AQNs ($C(p), T(p), S(p)$), its local relational context, its interactions with other patterns, and potentially its history or future potential under the dynamics ($\{r_i\}$). A primary component is the $S(p)/C(p)$ ratio, reflecting the stability per unit of complexity, but it could also include terms related to the pattern instance's specific $T$ properties (e.g., favoring specific symmetries or charge configurations via terms like $w_{k,T} \cdot \text{SymmetryScore}(p, G)$ based on local automorphism group structure, spectral properties, or proto-property configurations with algebraic structure, or rewarding specific algebraic properties of its constituent proto-properties), its local density or connectivity, its role in composite patterns, its participation in emergent relational structures (like cycles or dense communities), its information content (e.g., Shannon entropy of local properties, Kolmogorov complexity relative to local rules), or its contribution to global pattern density or interaction rates. $w_k$ are weighting factors for each pattern type (some patterns might be inherently more 'fit' or 'valuable' than others to the system's overall fitness, e.g., patterns corresponding to fundamental particles vs. transient structures or 'virtual' patterns, or patterns that facilitate the formation of other high-$L_A$ patterns). The PatternTerm can also include non-linear functions of AQNs or interaction terms, or terms rewarding patterns that facilitate the formation of other high-$L_A$ patterns. The computational cost of identifying patterns and computing their AQNs for *every potential successor state* at *every time step* is a major challenge requiring significant algorithmic optimization (see AUTX-M1). Incremental pattern identification and AQN updates are critical for efficient $L_A$ evaluation, focusing on patterns affected by the specific rule application.

        *   $\Lambda_{global}(G)$: Aggregates contributions from specific computable functions of metrics describing the overall state of the graph, its structure, and resource utilization at a global or macroscopic level. These terms constrain or reward macroscopic properties and emergent features, potentially linking to cosmological principles or fundamental constants.
            > $$ \Lambda_{global}(G) = \sum_{j} w'_j \cdot \text{GlobalMetric}_j(G) $$
            Examples of $\text{GlobalMetric}_j(G)$: total number of nodes/edges/relations (resource cost, potentially penalized to favor efficiency, analogous to minimizing action or energy or maximizing entropy per unit resource in physics), average/median node/edge degree, graph density, spectral properties of global graph matrices (Laplacian, Adjacency, Incidence, weighted by proto-properties – relating to connectivity, diffusion, vibration modes, energy levels of the graph structure, or global symmetries, potentially linking to concepts like temperature or vacuum energy, or phase transition indicators, or related to emergent wave phenomena or field modes), entropy measures on proto-property distributions (quantifying diversity/randomness/order of the fundamental qualities, e.g., Shannon entropy of the distribution of proto-properties across all nodes or edges, or joint entropy of properties across related nodes), counts of specific relation types or structural motifs (e.g., triangles, cliques, paths, cycles, specific high-level structures, distribution of cycle lengths), measures of graph "temperature" or activity (frequency of rule applications per node/edge in a region or globally, rate of change of properties, rate of information flow, variance in local $L_A$ over time), measures of connectivity (e.g., number of connected components, size of largest component, algebraic connectivity, graph diameter, minimum cut/separator size, resilience to random node/edge removal), measures of "small-worldness" or clustering coefficient, measures related to potential for future $L_A$ growth (e.g., number of currently available rule matches that *could* lead to high $L_A$ states but are not currently the single maximum, "stored energy" in property configurations ripe for rule application), measures of graph "order" or "regularity" vs. "randomness" (e.g., measures of compressibility relative to random graphs, measures of self-similarity or fractal properties), measures of information content (e.g., total information in pattern configurations, compression ratio of the graph state relative to a simple baseline, mutual information between different graph regions, total Kolmogorov complexity of the graph state relative to $\mathcal{R}$), measures of efficiency of information flow or processing within the graph, measures related to potential for structural phase transitions, measures of global symmetry (e.g., size/structure of the global automorphism group, counts of global symmetric motifs, spectral degeneracy, measures of symmetry breaking), measures of global resource distribution (e.g., evenness of distribution of specific proto-properties or patterns across the graph), measures related to emergent thermodynamic properties (e.g., effective pressure, volume, temperature derived from fluctuations or activity). $w'_j$ are their weights, which can be positive (rewards) or negative (penalties). Examples: penalizing isolated nodes, rewarding specific connectivity motifs, favoring states with high average $S/C$ of *all* identified subgraphs above a certain size, rewarding specific global symmetries (derived from global graph invariants or symmetries of the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ and $L_A$, e.g., global symmetries under permutation of nodes with identical properties or under transformations of relation types), penalizing resource consumption (nodes/edges) relative to generated stability/complexity, rewarding states with high average degree or specific degree distributions (e.g., scale-free networks), penalizing states that exhibit structural pathologies (e.g., excessive deep nesting, highly fragmented structure, low connectivity), rewarding states that facilitate efficient rule application or pattern identification, rewarding states with low graph diameter or high algebraic connectivity (indicating efficient communication/interaction), rewarding states with high clustering coefficient or community structure (indicating local organization).

        *   $\Lambda_{exploration}(G)$: Specifically designed to counteract premature convergence to simple local optima and promote the discovery of more complex, diverse, and globally favorable states (see DC4). These terms introduce a drive towards novelty, diversity, or potential for future growth, crucial for navigating a vast and potentially rugged $L_A$ landscape and explaining the emergence of complexity.
            > $$ \Lambda_{exploration}(G) = \sum_{l} w''_l \cdot \text{ExplorationTerm}_l(G) $$
            Examples of $\text{ExplorationTerm}_l(G)$: Novelty metrics (e.g., distance from recent states in state space using graph edit distance or AQN vector differences, rate of appearance of new pattern types or motifs, measure of structural change not accounted for by known patterns, measure of entropy increase not tied to pattern breakdown, decrease in compressibility relative to previous states, measures of distance in configuration space from previously visited states, distance in state space from states in the current basin of attraction), Diversity metrics (e.g., Shannon entropy of the distribution of $P_{ID}$ types or proto-property configurations, variety of structural motifs, richness of relation types, distribution of local graph structures, number of distinct connected components, measures of graph heterogeneity, variety of applicable rule types per node/region), Potential metrics (e.g., number of currently available rule matches that *could* lead to high $L_A$ states but are not currently the single maximum, measure of "disequilibrium" or "tension" in the graph that could be resolved by specific rules leading to significant structural change, number of potential matches for "high-yield" rules – rules known to produce high $L_A$ states or complex patterns, "potential energy" stored in specific proto-property configurations that are precursors to high-$L_A$ structures), Stagnation penalties (e.g., decrease in $L_A$ if the graph state or pattern composition hasn't changed significantly over several steps, penalty if the rate of rule application drops below a threshold, penalty for low diversity of applicable rules, penalty for low global activity or "temperature"). $w''_l$ are their weights, which can be positive (rewards exploration) or negative (penalizes stagnation). These terms represent a form of intrinsic 'curiosity', 'creativity', or a drive towards richer existence encoded in the fundamental fitness function, counteracting simple entropic decay or structural simplicity by making complex, ordered, and evolving states more "fit" than simple, stagnant ones. This component is crucial for explaining the universe's complexity and diversity, moving beyond mere stability towards a dynamic, self-organizing system. It guides the search for better attractors and is essential for bridging the gap between simple generative rules and complex emergent phenomena. It might also provide a mechanism for phenomena like cosmic inflation or the constant "bubbling up" of quantum fluctuations.

        *   $\Lambda_{constraints}(G)$: Terms that enforce or penalize specific structural or property constraints that are not strictly forbidden by rule applicability but are disfavored by the system. These act as soft constraints or preferences, guiding the system towards states that satisfy broader, potentially emergent principles or desired properties without hardcoding them into the rule grammar.
             > $$ \Lambda_{constraints}(G) = \sum_{m} w'''_m \cdot \text{ConstraintTerm}_m(G) $$
             Examples: Penalizing the presence of specific "forbidden" subgraphs or proto-property configurations that are not explicitly removed by rules but are undesirable from a fitness perspective (e.g., high-energy unstable configurations, structures violating emergent conservation laws that are not *strictly* conserved by rules but are strongly penalized in $L_A$, configurations with structural pathologies like excessively deep nesting or highly fragmented structure, low connectivity, lack of flow), rewarding configurations that satisfy desired emergent properties (e.g., rewarding states with high local or global symmetry, or low graph diameter, or specific clustering coefficients, or configurations exhibiting specific algebraic properties derived from proto-property configurations, or configurations that satisfy emergent relationships between AQNs like $E=mc^2$ analogues or mass-lifetime relations, or configurations exhibiting emergent gauge invariance or Lorentz invariance), penalizing configurations that are computationally "inefficient" for applying rules or identifying patterns (e.g., requiring excessive backtracking or resource usage in the underlying simulation process, linking to a form of computational cost in existence), penalizing configurations that violate consistency rules not explicitly encoded in $\mathcal{R}$ but desired for global coherence (e.g., configurations that would require adding many nodes/edges under a hypothetical global consistency check, or configurations that violate emergent causality or locality principles at macroscopic scales), penalizing structures analogous to topological defects or pathologies that are not explicitly forbidden by rules but are unfavorable for complexity or stability. These terms allow for expressing preferences for certain structures or states that contribute to overall coherence or stability even if not strictly enforced by the rule grammar alone, potentially acting as analogues for emergent potentials or energy landscapes, or defining a form of "thermodynamic pressure" or "tension" in the system.

        *   $\Lambda_{spacetime}(G)$: Terms specifically related to the emergence and properties of spacetime-like structures or metrics within the graph. These terms reward configurations that exhibit properties hypothesized to correspond to observed spacetime features, linking the graph structure and dynamics to emergent geometry and gravity.
             > $$ \Lambda_{spacetime}(G) = \sum_{p} w''''_p \cdot \text{SpacetimeTerm}_p(G) $$
             Examples: Rewarding configurations with stable, consistent effective dimensionality (e.g., measures of spectral dimension, fractal dimension, or embedding dimension close to 3+1, or measures of dimension related to the growth rate of graph volume with graph distance, or measures based on the number of independent directions for information propagation, or related to the algebraic structure of proto-properties or rules, or related to the structure of the emergent causal set, or dimension measures from persistent homology), favoring configurations where relations or patterns form structures with properties analogous to a metric tensor (e.g., measures of relational distance correlating with a metric, consistency of distance measures across different parts of the graph, measures of curvature based on graph structure or dynamics, correlations between pattern density and local graph metrics), penalizing configurations with highly irregular or pathological emergent geometric properties (e.g., negative curvature below a threshold, inconsistent measures of distance or dimensionality, lack of smooth transitions in emergent metric properties), rewarding configurations that exhibit specific large-scale structural features (e.g., homogeneity and isotropy on large scales, specific power spectrum for density fluctuations, emergence of structures analogous to light cones or causal horizons, emergence of structures resembling a manifold at large scales, specific clustering properties or community structures), rewarding configurations where the rate of rule application or information flow is consistent across regions (analogue of constant speed of light), rewarding configurations where density/complexity of patterns correlates with changes in emergent metric properties (analogue of matter/energy influencing spacetime curvature, potentially leading to emergent gravitational effects), rewarding configurations that exhibit properties analogous to cosmic expansion or specific cosmological parameters (e.g., terms rewarding structures whose large-scale relational distance is increasing over time in a specific manner consistent with observed expansion, or whose density distribution matches observed cosmological parameters, or that exhibit properties analogous to inflation or dark energy). Specific examples of metrics could include graph distances based on weighted shortest paths (where weights are derived from relation properties), measures of Ollivier-Ricci curvature or other discrete curvature analogues on the graph, spectral dimension derived from the graph Laplacian, or measures of geodesic completeness/incompleteness. These terms provide the explicit link between the abstract graph state and the emergent geometric and gravitational properties of reality, guiding the system towards configurations that 'look like' our universe's spacetime. This is where the connection to GR and cosmology is explicitly encoded in the fitness function.

        *   $\Lambda_{quantum}(G)$: Terms specifically related to the emergence and properties of quantum-like phenomena. These terms reward configurations that exhibit properties hypothesized to correspond to observed quantum features.
             > $$ \Lambda_{quantum}(G) = \sum_{q} w'''''_q \cdot \text{QuantumTerm}_q(G) $$
             Examples: Rewarding states exhibiting properties analogous to superposition (e.g., a distinction or pattern instance participating in multiple relational configurations or having multiple proto-property sets simultaneously in a probabilistic or correlated manner, potentially represented by quantum graph states or linear combinations of graph states, or by specific proto-property configurations allowing multiple potential interpretations or interaction pathways simultaneously, potentially representable using algebraic structures like Clifford algebras or Jordan algebras for proto-properties where non-commuting properties exist), favoring configurations that exhibit interference patterns in rule application outcomes or pattern formation probabilities (e.g., probabilities of forming a pattern in one way interfering with probabilities of forming it another way, destructive/constructive interference in the probability landscape of state transitions, or interference patterns in correlations between patterns, potentially related to spectral properties or wave-like dynamics on the graph), rewarding configurations with specific non-local correlations between distant distinctions/patterns (analogous to entanglement, potentially modeled by specific non-local relation types or correlated proto-property assignments established by rules or the $L_A$ principle, or by structures in a categorical framework, or correlations arising from non-commuting proto-properties), rewarding configurations that exhibit discrete "energy levels" or quantized properties (e.g., AQNs taking on discrete values, spectral properties of patterns being quantized, $L_A$ values of states being quantized, or quantization arising from the discrete nature of the graph structure, rule set, or proto-property algebra), favoring rule application outcomes that satisfy uncertainty principle analogues (e.g., penalizing configurations where conjugate properties are simultaneously sharply defined below a certain threshold, or where simultaneously measuring two emergent properties would require applying incompatible rule sets with high $L_A$, potentially related to non-commuting operators derived from proto-property algebras or rule applications), rewarding configurations where pattern interactions exhibit probabilistic outcomes or scattering cross-sections matching quantum predictions (derived from $I_R$), rewarding states exhibiting properties analogous to wave-particle duality (e.g., patterns behaving like localized entities in some contexts and exhibiting wave-like interference or diffraction patterns in others, potentially related to graph spectral properties or diffusion processes on the graph, or to the relationship between $C$ and $T$), rewarding states exhibiting non-commutative properties in their proto-property algebra or interaction dynamics, rewarding states that support emergent linear dynamics on some aspect of the state space (analogue of Schrödinger equation), rewarding states where measurements (modeled as specific rule applications that collapse potential futures) have probabilistic outcomes weighted by $L_A$-related "amplitudes". These terms guide the system towards states that manifest quantum mechanics at the emergent level. This is where the link to quantum mechanics is explicitly encoded in the fitness function, potentially through terms rewarding specific algebraic structures on properties or patterns that mirror those in quantum mechanics (e.g., non-commutative algebras, Hilbert space analogues derived from pattern state spaces).

        *   $\Lambda_{algebraic}(G)$: Terms specifically related to rewarding graph states or patterns that exhibit specific algebraic structures in their proto-properties or relational composition that are hypothesized to underlie emergent conservation laws and symmetries.
             > $$ \Lambda_{algebraic}(G) = \sum_{a} w''''''_a \cdot \text{AlgebraicTerm}_a(G) $$
             Examples: Rewarding configurations where sums or combinations of specific proto-properties within a pattern instance or across interacting patterns are conserved under rule applications (e.g., if proto-properties form representations of an abstract group, rewarding configurations where the total group element represented by a pattern or set of patterns is conserved under rule applications, analogous to charge or color conservation), favoring configurations where certain transformations of the graph state (e.g., permutation of nodes with specific properties, transformation of relation types) leave $L_A$ invariant (analogous to gauge symmetries or global symmetries), rewarding patterns whose internal proto-property configurations or relational structures form specific algebraic structures (e.g., Lie algebra representations, Clifford algebras, Jordan algebras, algebraic structures isomorphic to those found in particle physics like the Standard Model gauge group $U(1) \times SU(2) \times SU(3)$ or algebras related to spin), penalizing configurations that violate algebraic consistency rules defined on proto-properties, rewarding states where emergent interaction rules ($I_R$) exhibit specific symmetry properties (e.g., Lorentz invariance, gauge invariance, CPT symmetry, internal symmetries like flavor or isospin symmetry). These terms link the abstract algebraic structures defined on the fundamental properties to the emergent symmetries and conservation laws of physics. This is where the link to abstract algebra and symmetry principles in physics is explicitly encoded.

        *   $\Lambda_{thermodynamic}(G)$: Terms related to emergent thermodynamic properties and behaviors.
            > $$ \Lambda_{thermodynamic}(G) = \sum_{th} w'''''''_{th} \cdot \text{ThermodynamicTerm}_{th}(G) $$
            Examples: Penalizing states with excessive free energy analogue (e.g., high density of unstable configurations or configurations ripe for high-$L_A$ increasing rule applications), rewarding states with specific entropy characteristics (e.g., high entropy of proto-property distribution within patterns, but low entropy of pattern distribution across the graph, or terms related to algorithmic entropy or computational cost), rewarding states that exhibit properties analogous to phase transitions or critical phenomena (e.g., measures of fluctuation or correlation length reaching critical values), terms related to emergent temperature or pressure gradients, penalizing configurations that would require significant "work" (cumulative $L_A$ change) to transition to higher fitness states, rewarding states that facilitate efficient dissipation of "computational heat" (low-$L_A$ rule applications or transformations). These terms connect the abstract dynamics to statistical physics and thermodynamics, potentially explaining the thermodynamic arrow of time (H1.1) and concepts like cosmic expansion or the heat death of the universe.

        *   $\Lambda_{computational}(G)$: Terms related to the intrinsic "computational" cost or efficiency of the graph state, viewing the universe as a computation.
            > $$ \Lambda_{computational}(G) = \sum_{comp} w''''''''_{comp} \cdot \text{ComputationalTerm}_{comp}(G) $$
            Examples: Penalizing configurations that are computationally expensive to process or simulate given the rule set (e.g., high tree-width or clique number, high complexity of subgraph isomorphism problems they contain, requiring excessive memory/processing resources in the underlying simulation engine, configurations leading to combinatorial explosion of rule matches), rewarding configurations that facilitate efficient rule application or pattern identification, rewarding states with high information processing capacity (e.g., measures of information flow, rate of rule application per unit of graph resource, measures related to computational depth or circuit complexity of the graph structure), penalizing configurations that lead to non-termination or infinite loops in rule application sequences if not handled by other terms, rewarding configurations that are "compressible" or exhibit algorithmic regularity (linking back to AIT). These terms introduce a form of computational efficiency or resource constraint into the fundamental fitness function, potentially reflecting a deeper principle of computational parsimony or efficiency in the universe's fundamental process. This could relate to Landauer's principle or the thermodynamic cost of computation.

        *   The function $F$ combines these components into a single scalar value. $F$ could be a simple weighted sum, a polynomial, a non-linear function (e.g., involving thresholds, interactions between terms, ratios), a product (e.g., $L_A$ as a probability density analogue), or a more complex aggregation. The specific functional form $L_A(G)$, its parameters, and the weighting factors ($w_k, w'_j, w''_l, w'''_m, w''''_p, w'''''_q, w''''''_a, w'''''''_{th}, w''''''''_{comp}$) constitute a critical part of the Autaxys Configuration. The choice of $L_A$ encodes the fundamental "aesthetic," "goal," or "selection pressure" that shapes the emergent reality. Different $L_A$ functions will lead to universes with different emergent properties and fundamental "laws." Defining and refining $L_A$ is a major scientific challenge within the framework (see AUTX-M1). The $L_A$ function might itself be learned or evolved over cosmic time in more advanced theoretical extensions, but for v2.0 it is fixed for a given configuration. The computational efficiency of $L_A$ evaluation is directly tied to the complexity of its functional form and the efficiency of the underlying pattern identification and AQN computation algorithms. Incremental $L_A$ updates based on localized rule effects are crucial for performance. The design of $L_A$ is a hypothesis about the fundamental values or preferences inherent in reality.

    *   **The Selection Principle:** At each discrete step $t$, from the set of all possible immediate successor states $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$, the system selects the unique state $G_{t+1}$ that yields the maximum instantaneous value of the Autaxic Lagrangian (standard greedy selection). Alternatively, and crucially for incorporating the Exploration Drive (DC4) and potentially modeling quantum probability, the selection can be made probabilistically based on an $L_A$-dependent distribution over $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$. This implements a non-greedy selection from $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$.
    > $$ G_{t+1} = \underset{G' \in \mathcal{P}(G_t)}{\text{argmax}} (L_A(G')) \quad \text{(Standard Greedy Selection)} $$
    > $$ P(G_{t+1} = G') = \frac{f(L_A(G'), \text{ExplorationParams}, G_t, \mathcal{R})}{\sum_{G'' \in \mathcal{P}(G_t)} f(L_A(G''), \text{ExplorationParams}, G_t, \mathcal{R})} \quad \text{(Probabilistic Selection, e.g., Boltzmann, with DC4 influence and context dependence)} $$
    *   In the deterministic greedy model, ties where multiple successor states yield the exact same maximum $L_A$ must be resolved by a fixed, deterministic tie-breaking rule (e.g., based on a canonical ordering of rule indices, match locations encoded as node/edge IDs, or resulting graph state encodings, or a canonical hash of the resulting graph state). This ensures a unique trajectory for a given configuration and initial state, facilitating debugging and analysis, though a truly realistic model of fundamental reality might require inherent non-determinism.

    *   **Tie-Breaking & Exploration (DC4 Implementation in P3):** To incorporate the Exploration Drive (DC4) and potentially model quantum-like behavior or ensure state space coverage in simulations, a non-deterministic or probabilistic element is introduced here, replacing or augmenting the deterministic greedy selection (P3, DC4 in `D-P6.2-4`, 3.1.2 in AUTX-M1). This implements a non-greedy selection from $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$. Examples of selection functions $f(\cdot, \cdot)$:
        *   **Probabilistic Selection:** Selecting from $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$ based on a probability distribution where $P(G' | G_t)$ is a function of $L_A(G')$ and potentially other factors related to DC4 and the current state $G_t$. A common choice is a Boltzmann distribution: $f(L_A(G'), \beta, G_t) = \exp(\beta L_A(G'))$, where $\beta$ is a parameter analogous to inverse temperature, controlling the degree of randomness (high $\beta \implies$ more greedy; low $\beta \implies$ more random, exploring lower $L_A$ states). This allows lower-$L_A$ states to be selected with non-zero probability, enabling the system to "jump" out of local $L_A$ minima and explore states that are not immediately optimal but might lead to higher $L_A$ states later. $\beta$ could be fixed or could be a dynamic parameter of the system, potentially evolving over cosmic time (e.g., decreasing like an annealing schedule, leading to less exploration and more exploitation as the universe "cools" or matures, potentially linking to the thermodynamic arrow of time or phase transitions, or dependent on global metrics like graph density or average $L_A$). Other distributions (e.g., power-law distributions, rank-weighted distributions, Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein like distributions based on $L_A$ "energy levels") could also be used, potentially linking to statistical mechanics formalisms. The probabilistic nature of this selection might be the origin of quantum probability, with the wave function potentially related to the probability distribution over possible graph states or transformation sequences in $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$, or over possible outcomes of specific rule applications, providing a generative model for quantum randomness and fluctuations. The probability distribution could also be dependent on specific properties of the current state $G_t$ or the rules being applied, for instance, favoring rules that lead to novel states under certain conditions. This provides a concrete computational model for the origin of quantum probability at the fundamental level.
        *   **$\epsilon$-Greedy Selection:** With probability $1-\epsilon$, select the state with maximum $L_A$; with probability $\epsilon$, select a random state from $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$ (or a random state from a subset of high-$L_A$ states, or a random state generated by a specific set of "exploratory" rules, or a state with high novelty/diversity score). $\epsilon$ controls the level of random exploration and could also be a dynamic parameter, potentially decreasing over time or dependent on global state properties.
        *   **Rank-Based Selection:** Select probabilistically from the top-k $L_A$ scoring states, with probabilities potentially weighted by rank or $L_A$ value (e.g., favoring the top states but giving others a chance).
        *   **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Instead of a single scalar $L_A$, the selection could be based on optimizing multiple criteria simultaneously (e.g., maximizing $L_A$, maximizing novelty, minimizing resource cost, maximizing diversity), using techniques from multi-objective optimization. Some criteria might favor stability, others complexity, and others exploration or diversity, with the selection involving finding Pareto optimal states or using a weighted combination that isn't a simple sum, allowing for trade-offs between competing fitness goals (e.g., maximizing stability AND diversity, even if they are in tension). The selection principle could prioritize potential for future $L_A$ growth as well as current $L_A$. This requires defining vector-valued objective functions and a selection rule based on Pareto dominance or weighted sums.
        *   **Rule-Specific Selection Bias:** Some rules in $\mathcal{R}$ might have an inherent selection bias (a "propensity" or "weight") independent of or modifying their $L_A$ contribution, especially if they represent rare processes or interactions with hypothetical background fields (though in Autaxys, these biases should ideally emerge from the $L_A$ dynamics or context conditions).
        *   **Context-Dependent Stochasticity:** The level of stochasticity or the specific probabilistic selection mechanism might depend on the local or global context of the graph state $G_t$, for example, being higher in regions of low $L_A$, low pattern density, or high structural disorder, or lower in regions of high $L_A$ or high pattern stability. This could link to concepts like vacuum fluctuations or phase transitions.
    *   The specific mechanism for handling ties and incorporating exploration (as part of DC4) is a critical parameterizable component of the Autaxys Configuration under investigation (4.1.4.4 in AUTX-M1), impacting the system's ability to discover and settle into complex attractors. This selection process, repeated at each step, forms the deterministic (or probabilistic) time evolution $G_t \to G_{t+1}$. The integrated Autaxic Action $A_A = \sum_{t=0}^{N} L_A(G_t)$ over a history is a consequence of this local rule, not necessarily the primary optimization target over long time horizons in the greedy model, although maximizing local $L_A$ is hypothesized to generally lead towards trajectories with higher total $A_A$ or towards high-$L_A$ attractor states. The long-term behavior is dominated by the attractor landscape shaped by $L_A$ and $\mathcal{R}$, and the Exploration Drive determines how effectively this landscape is explored and which attractors are reached. The selection principle is the "engine" that drives the system through the state space according to the landscape defined by $L_A$ and the rules. The probabilistic selection mechanism, if used, offers a concrete computational model for the origin of quantum probability and fluctuations at the most fundamental level, where the universe "chooses" among possible next states with probabilities related to their "fitness." This provides a generative explanation for quantum randomness. This selection process provides the fundamental 'time' dimension of the universe, where each step is a discrete unit of change.

**Derived Concepts (Internal to the Formalism):**

1.  **DC1 (Emergent Patterns - $P_{ID}$s):** These are attributed subgraph configurations that exhibit persistence, recurrence, and structural integrity over significant durations within the global graph dynamics defined by P2 and P3. They effectively achieve a degree of dynamic stability and self-maintenance against the background of continuous transformation. They are identified as distinct pattern types ($P_{ID}$s - Pattern Identifiers) if instances of the subgraph configuration and its associated proto-properties recurrently emerge and are maintained across different simulations or regions, exhibiting a degree of *Ontological Closure* (DC3). They act as dynamic units, "quasi-particles," composite structures, or emergent objects within the relational substrate, exhibiting properties and behaviors distinct from the underlying distinctions and relations. Their emergence signifies a spontaneous self-organization of the substrate into semi-autonomous, stable entities, akin to dissipative structures, solitons, or self-organizing patterns in complex systems, but with precise, quantifiable properties (AQNs). Their identity is defined by their stable attributed graph structure, their characteristic statistical distribution of AQNs (DC2), and their emergent interaction behaviors ($I_R$).
    *   **Formal Identification:** Involves sophisticated computational algorithms for detecting frequent, persistent, or structurally invariant attributed subgraphs in simulation trajectories and final states (DC1 in `D-P6.2-4`, 5.2 in AUTX-M1). This requires techniques robust to minor structural variations or 'noise' (transient differences in non-essential parts of the pattern's relational context or non-critical proto-properties). Methods include: frequent attributed subgraph mining algorithms (e.g., gSpan, MoFa, GADEM extended for attributes and dynamic graphs, SUBDUE, specifically adapted for attributed dynamic graphs with multisets), graph clustering algorithms (e.g., based on graph kernels, spectral properties, or attributed graph metrics, community detection adapted for attributed graphs like Modularity maximization or Louvain method, clustering based on node or edge embeddings learned by GNNs, attribute-aware clustering), topological data analysis (identifying persistent topological features within subgraphs across different filtration values defined by relations or proto-properties, e.g., persistent homology of metric spaces derived from attribute/structure distance), and quantitatively assessing their *Ontological Closure* ($S$) and relative *Complexity* ($C$). Pattern identification can be done via template matching against a library of known or hypothesized $P_{ID}$ types (e.g., pre-defined patterns corresponding to theoretical particle structures) or via unsupervised clustering of frequent and stable subgraphs found in simulation data. Patterns can be simple (e.g., a few nodes and relations with specific proto-properties, like the 'bonded +/- pair' in MVU-1) or complex, hierarchical composites built from instances of simpler, recognized $P_{ID}$s (e.g., a pattern representing a proton analogue might be identified as a composite structure consisting of three identified 'quark' patterns bound by specific 'gluon-like' relational structures, which are themselves patterns). The identification process is often iterative and bootstrapped: simpler, highly stable patterns are identified first, and then algorithms search for recurrent structures composed of these simpler patterns, potentially forming a hierarchical taxonomy of patterns, analogous to how protons and neutrons are composites of quarks, and atoms are composites of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Automated classification and canonical representation of $P_{ID}$ instances (e.g., using canonical graph labeling extended for attributes and relational multisets, feature vectors derived from AQNs and local structure, graph embeddings learned by GNNs, or abstract algebraic descriptors derived from proto-property configurations) are crucial for scalable analysis across large ensembles. Criteria for distinguishing "fundamental" $P_{ID}$s from composite or transient structures can include minimal complexity, maximal stability-to-complexity ratio, being irreducible under the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ (i.e., not being constructible from simpler $P_{ID}$s via rule applications involving only those simpler patterns alone, implying they require fundamental rule applications involving only basic distinctions/relations for their formation, or are not composed of identifiable sub-patterns), or being statistically dominant attractors in the state space. Patterns can be localized in the graph (occupying a connected subgraph) or potentially distributed/non-local, defined by correlations or specific relations between distant distinctions/subgraphs, which could be relevant for modeling entanglement, quantum correlations, or field-like phenomena (e.g., a field excitation might be a persistent pattern of correlations across a region of the graph, not localized to a single subgraph, or a pattern defined by a specific global topological invariant). Identifying non-local patterns is a significant computational challenge requiring different graph analysis techniques (e.g., analysis of correlation functions, information flow, or persistent homology on the global graph, or using graph wavelets, or analyzing attribute correlations across distances). Pattern identification must be efficient enough to be integrated into the $L_A$ calculation loop for potential successor states (P3). Formal, algorithmic criteria for defining persistence and recurrence in dynamic graphs are essential (5.2 in AUTX-M1).

    *   $P_{ID}$s are the candidates for the fundamental constituents of observed reality (particles, fields, composite structures, potentially even emergent spacetime structures or topological defects). Their identity is defined by their stable attributed graph structure, their characteristic statistical distribution of AQNs (DC2), and their emergent interaction behaviors ($I_R$). The discovery and characterization of these patterns is the primary output of the Autaxys generative modeling process and forms the basis of the Autaxic Table (H1.2).

2.  **DC2 (Autaxic Quantum Numbers - AQNs):** These are quantifiable, intrinsic properties of emergent patterns ($P_{ID}$s), derived computationally from the structure, proto-properties, and dynamic resilience of their corresponding attributed subgraphs ($G_{P_{ID}}$) within the AGE dynamics (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`). They are hypothesized to map directly to observable physical properties of fundamental particles, composite structures, and forces. AQNs provide the quantitative link between the abstract relational substrate and empirical measurements. They are not fundamental inputs but are computed from the emergent structure and dynamics, representing the 'measurable' characteristics of the emergent entities. The specific set of AQNs and their mapping to physical properties is part of the hypothesis and refined through comparison with observation. The statistical distributions of AQNs for each pattern type, calculated across ensembles (MVU-2+), provide the quantitative predictions of the theory, including uncertainties and correlations (H1.2, H1.3).
    *   **Complexity ($C$):** The AQN corresponding to observed mass and energy content ($E=mc^2$) of a pattern instance. Formalized using **Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT)**. $C(P_{ID}) \approx K_{\mathcal{R}}(G_{P_{ID}})$, the Kolmogorov Complexity of the pattern's attributed subgraph structure and proto-property assignment *relative to the Cosmic Algorithm rule set $\mathcal{R}$* used as the reference programming language/Turing machine (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`). This is the length of the shortest valid sequence of rule applications from $\mathcal{R}$, starting from a minimal initial state (e.g., an empty graph or a few basic distinctions), required to deterministically generate an instance of $G_{P_{ID}}$ in its specific form and attributed state, relative to its context. This measures the irreducible generative "cost," resource accumulation (distinctions, relations, properties), or intrinsic information content of the pattern within the system's own grammar. It is the minimal description length of the pattern using the language of the fundamental rules, representing the algorithmic "effort" or information required to construct it.
        *   **Computational Approximation:** Exact $K$ is uncomputable. Practical computation relies on robust, computable approximations suitable for dynamic attributed graph structures and scalable for ensemble analysis (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`, 3.1.3.1 in AUTX-M1):
            *   Length of the shortest *observed* derivation sequence found in simulations leading to the pattern (requires tracking history and can be path-dependent; useful for understanding specific instances, less so for general pattern types, and is only an upper bound).
            *   Lempel-Ziv complexity, Normalized Compression Distance (NCD), or standard compression algorithms (e.g., gzip, LZW) applied to a standardized, canonical linear encoding (e.g., adjacency list with attributes, graph traversal sequence, canonical string representation of attributed graph, feature vector representation derived from graph metrics and proto-property distributions, graph embeddings learned by GNNs) of the attributed graph structure and properties of $G_{P_{ID}}$. NCD between two patterns can also approximate their 'distance' in complexity space.
            *   Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle: The size of the most efficient encoding of the pattern using the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ as the encoding grammar (e.g., number of rule applications), plus the cost of encoding any exceptions or the pattern's specific context. This requires developing a formal coding scheme based on $\mathcal{R}$ and the configuration.
            *   Structural proxies: Simple, easily computable attributed graph metrics that empirically correlate with complexity, such as number of nodes, edges, unique proto-property instances, total count of proto-properties, counts of specific complex motifs, measures of graph "depth" or hierarchical complexity (if the pattern is composite), measures of structural interconnectedness within $G_{P_{ID}}$ (e.g., tree width, cycle counts, minimum bisection width, various connectivity measures, graph diameter), entropy measures on the pattern's local proto-property distribution, metrics derived from spectral graph theory on the pattern subgraph (e.g., sum of eigenvalues of the Laplacian, distribution of eigenvalues, measures related to graph energy), or feature vectors from Graph Neural Networks trained to predict complexity. These are often used as initial estimators, particularly in large-scale MVU-2 analysis due to their computational efficiency. Relative complexities between patterns generated within the same configuration are often more meaningful than absolute values for comparison purposes. The distribution of these approximated $C$ values across many instances of a pattern type in an ensemble provides a statistical prediction for the pattern's mass/energy analogue, including variance and potential correlations with other AQNs (H1.2, H1.3). Comparing these distributions to the mass spectrum of observed particles is a key validation step (H1.3). The mean value of $C$ for a pattern type is the prediction for its rest mass analogue.

        *   **Implication:** Observed mass/energy is an emergent property reflecting the irreducible informational/structural 'cost', resource accumulation (in terms of distinctions/relations/properties), or inherent organizational complexity required to instantiate and maintain a stable configuration within the generative system's own language. Higher complexity patterns require more 'work' (rule applications, underlying resources) to form and maintain, potentially correlating with their 'energy' or 'mass' analogue. This connects to ideas of mass as bound energy or information content within a specific computational substrate. The $E=mc^2$ relation might emerge as a fundamental relationship between the stability ($S$) required to maintain a certain complexity ($C$), potentially related to the energy cost ($\Delta E_{OC}$) of breaking ontological closure, where $\Delta E_{OC}$ represents an energy barrier and $C$ represents the 'mass' or 'inertia' of the pattern. The statistical distribution of $C$ values for emergent patterns in simulations should statistically match the mass spectrum of observed particles, including their rest mass and potentially kinetic energy analogues related to their dynamics within the graph (e.g., if velocity or momentum are also emergent AQNs related to dynamic properties, or if energy relates to activity or oscillation frequency within the pattern).

    *   **Topology ($T$):** The AQN corresponding to observed internal quantum numbers such as electric charge, spin, color charge, weak isospin, baryon number, lepton number, parity, and other discrete conserved quantities. Formalized using **Group Theory** and **Attributed Graph Invariants**. $T(P_{ID})$ is a set of descriptors derived from the symmetry properties, structural invariants, and stable proto-property configurations of $G_{P_{ID}}$ (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`). It captures the pattern's intrinsic qualitative nature and how it transforms under internal rearrangements or interactions. It represents the inherent qualitative 'identity' of the pattern type.
        *   **Attributed Automorphism Group ($Aut(G_{P_{ID}}, f_{P_{ID}}, R_{P_{ID}}^{multiset})$):** The group of all isomorphisms of the underlying graph structure of $G_{P_{ID}}$ that *also* preserve the assigned proto-properties $f_{P_{ID}}$ and respect the multiset nature of relations (i.e., map edge instance $(u,v,k)$ to $(u',v',k')$ preserving $k$ or specific relation property that differentiates it). These symmetries represent internal invariances of the pattern under rearrangement that preserves its identity and properties. The algebraic structure of this group (its order, generators, relations, subgroups, quotient groups, center), its irreducible representations, and its relationship to the proto-property algebra are hypothesized to correspond directly to observed conservation laws and charges under fundamental forces and the emergent gauge symmetries (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`). For example, specific subgroups of $Aut(G_{P_{ID}})$ might reveal symmetries corresponding to $U(1)$ (related to charge conservation), $SU(2)$ (related to weak isospin), or $SU(3)$ (related to color charge or emergent internal degrees of freedom like flavor or generation). Specific patterns ($P_{ID}$s) transforming according to particular irreducible representations of these symmetry groups (e.g., how the pattern's structure or properties change under group operations acting on its constituent distinctions/relations) would correspond to particles exhibiting those charges (e.g., a pattern being in the fundamental representation of an $SU(3)$ subgroup could be a quark analogue; a pattern in the trivial representation could be neutral). The representation theory of these groups is key to mapping emergent symmetries to particle properties and their behavior under emergent forces and deriving the structure of the emergent gauge groups. Computing automorphism groups for large attributed graphs with multisets is computationally challenging, requiring efficient algorithms adapted from graph theory and computational group theory (e.g., NAUTY, Traces, Bliss, adapted for attributes and multisets). Approximations based on local symmetries or specific feature vectors derived from structure and attributes (e.g., using graph kernels, spectral features, algebraic invariants, or GNN embeddings trained to predict symmetry properties) can be used for large-scale analysis (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`, 3.1.3.2 in AUTX-M1).

        *   **Other Attributed Invariants**: Additional computable graph invariants and stable proto-property configurations provide further topological, qualitative, and potentially conserved characterization (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`):
            *   **Spectral Graph Theory**: Eigenvalue distributions (spectra) of matrices derived from the attributed graph (e.g., adjacency matrix, Laplacian, normalized Laplacian, incidence matrix, weighted by relation/node proto-properties, or matrices constructed from specific combinations of properties). These relate to connectivity, cycles, diffusion properties, energy levels of graph structures, and global structure, and can map to energy levels, oscillation modes, or other quantum numbers like spin (e.g., related to eigenvalues of a graph Laplacian analogue of a Dirac operator, or properties related to cycles or embedding properties, or related to the algebraic structure of proto-properties, particularly representations of $SU(2)$ or similar groups, or related to graph energy or eigenvalues of graph operators). The degeneracy of eigenvalues can relate to symmetry. Specific spectral properties or their distributions across pattern instances can provide a robust signature for $T$. For example, the spectrum of the graph Laplacian is invariant under graph isomorphism and can characterize topological features and connectivity; weighting it by properties introduces attribute dependence. Measures related to chirality (e.g., lack of reflective symmetry in the graph structure or attribute distribution, or properties of the automorphism group) could relate to emergent handedness or parity.
            *   **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)**: Persistent homology applied to a metric space derived from the attributed graph structure and proto-properties (e.g., using graph distance, or metrics based on attribute similarity or interaction potential). Identifies persistent topological features (connected components, cycles, voids, higher-dimensional analogues - Betti numbers) across different filtration scales defined by relations or proto-properties. This could relate to concepts like topological charge, linking numbers, winding numbers, or emergent internal dimensions of the pattern's structure. For example, cycles with specific properties might relate to flux lines or conserved quantities. Persistent homology can provide a robust, scale-independent signature of a pattern's underlying topology, potentially linking to concepts like topological solitons or defects. This can capture features that are invariant even if the graph structure changes slightly.
            *   **Proto-property Sums/Configurations**: Specific counts, sums (if proto-properties have algebraic structure, e.g., elements of a finite field or group), or invariant relative arrangements of proto-properties within the pattern that are conserved under the dynamics or rule applications (e.g., if rules conserve a sum of abstract 'polarity' proto-properties, this conserved sum could map to electric charge; specific arrangements of 'color' proto-properties to color charge; cyclic structures involving specific relation types and properties to spin or angular momentum; counts of specific 'identity markers' to baryon or lepton number). These are often simpler to compute than full automorphism groups and provide valuable features for pattern classification and AQN estimation in large datasets. The algebraic structure of $\Pi_D, \Pi_R$ and the conservation properties of rule applications are fundamental to which conserved quantities emerge. These proto-property configurations can be seen as 'internal states' of the pattern. This directly links the fundamental properties to emergent conserved quantities. For example, if proto-properties are elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and rules conserve the sum modulo $n$, this could lead to an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_n$ charge. If properties form representations of a Lie algebra, their composition under rules could mirror Lie algebra operations, leading to conservation laws associated with that algebra.
            *   **Knot Theory Analogs**: For patterns involving complex cyclic structures or embeddings within the larger graph, invariants from knot theory or graph link invariants could potentially relate to topological quantum numbers or conserved quantities, analogous to topological solitons or defects in field theories.
            *   **Algebraic Invariants:** If proto-properties form an algebra, invariants of this algebra under rule-induced transformations or internal pattern symmetries can be used to define $T$. E.g., trace of matrices formed by properties, determinants, specific polynomial invariants. If the rules correspond to operations in a category or groupoid, invariants under these operations can define T.
            *   **Representations of Abstract Algebras:** If proto-properties are hypothesized to form representations of specific abstract algebras (e.g., Lie algebras, Clifford algebras, Jordan algebras), the specific representation space occupied by a pattern's properties could define its $T$ (e.g., spin quantum numbers from representations of $SU(2)$ or the Clifford algebra). Rule applications could correspond to operations within these algebras, encoding conservation laws. This provides a direct link between abstract algebraic structures and emergent quantum numbers and symmetries.

        *   These invariants and symmetries are hypothesized to map to quantum numbers like spin (related to symmetries of the graph structure under 'rotation' or re-embedding in a higher-dimensional conceptual space, or related to cyclic structures or spectral properties, or related to the algebraic structure of proto-properties, particularly representations of $SU(2)$ or similar groups, or related to graph energy or eigenvalues of graph operators), parity (related to 'inversion' or mirror symmetries in structure or attributes), and conserved numbers (related to symmetries under exchange or transformation of internal components or particle-antiparticle conjugation, or related to topological invariants or conserved proto-property sums, or related to symmetries of the rule set or $L_A$). The specific mapping from group representations/invariants/proto-property configurations to physical quantum numbers is a key part of the configuration refinement process and is empirically validated by comparing simulated AQNs to experimental data (H1.3). The statistical distribution of these invariants across ensembles provides the quantitative prediction for the pattern's quantum numbers, including their discrete values, degeneracy, and any correlations. Comparison of these distributions to experimental particle properties (charge, spin, quantum numbers, magnetic moments, mixing angles) is a key validation step (H1.3).

    *   **Stability ($S$):** The AQN corresponding to observed lifetime, decay rates, and interaction cross-sections (quantifying resilience to disruption). Formalized using concepts from **Dynamical Systems Theory**, **Perturbation Analysis**, and **Statistical Analysis of Ensembles**.
        *   A stable pattern instance corresponds to a robust **attractor** (fixed point, limit cycle, or more complex attractor) in the graph state space under the AGE dynamics defined by $\mathcal{R}$ and $L_A$. Meta-stable patterns correspond to less robust attractors or limit cycles with finite escape paths. Unstable "patterns" are transient states outside of significant attractor basins. The state space is the set of all possible ARGs under a given configuration, and the dynamics define a flow or transition probabilities on this space.

        *   The stability $S(P_{ID})$ is quantitatively proportional to the "depth" or resilience of this attractor basin. This depth is measured by the minimum "escape energy" ($\Delta E_{OC}$) required to break the pattern's *Ontological Closure* (DC3) (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`). $\Delta E_{OC}$ is the minimal "cost" or "effort" associated with a sequence of rule applications (a "perturbation") required to transform an instance of $G_{P_{ID}}$ into a state where it is no longer identifiable as that $P_{ID}$. This cost is defined in terms of the cumulative impact on the Autaxic Lagrangian along the escape path.
        > $$ S(P_{ID}) \propto \Delta E_{OC}(P_{ID}) = \min_{\text{perturbation seq } \sigma} \left( \sum_{(r_i, \mu) \in \sigma} \Delta L_A(G_{current} \xrightarrow{(r_i, \mu)} G_{next}) \right) $$
        where $\Delta L_A(G_{current} \to G_{next}) = L_A(G_{next}) - L_A(G_{current})$, and the minimum is taken over all sequences of rule applications $\sigma = ((r_{i_1}, \mu_1), (r_{i_2}, \mu_2), ...)$ that, when applied sequentially starting from a graph containing an instance of $G_{P_{ID}}$ in its stable configuration and relational context, result in a state where the pattern instance is destroyed or fundamentally altered according to the pattern identification criteria. The sum represents the total required *positive* change in $L_A$ from the environment (if $\Delta L_A$ are positive, requiring the environment to "push" the system up an $L_A$ hill) or the minimum cumulative $L_A$ change (which might involve negative steps if the path goes through lower $L_A$ states) to destabilize the pattern. A pattern is stable if any rule application *within* it or relationally *proximate* to it either maintains its structure or is quickly reversed by subsequent $L_A$-maximizing steps, or if breaking it requires a sequence of rule applications that collectively cause a significant drop in $L_A$ (an "energy barrier") or require a specific, unlikely sequence of rules/matches. This is analogous to the activation energy in chemical reactions or escape energy from a potential well.

        *   **Computational Approximation:** $\Delta E_{OC}$ is computationally challenging to find exactly (involves searching state space). Practical computation relies on approximations (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`, 3.1.3.3, 4.1.2.2.4 in AUTX-M1):
            *   Simulating targeted perturbations: Apply various possible rule applications or sequences of rules in the vicinity of a pattern instance and measure the resulting local and global $L_A$ changes and structural deviations. The minimum cumulative $L_A$ drop (or maximum required $L_A$ increase from the environment) required to break the pattern corresponds to an approximation of $\Delta E_{OC}$. This is analogous to finding escape paths from potential energy minima or calculating activation energies in chemistry. Search algorithms (e.g., A* search on the state space of local transformations, graph search, Monte Carlo Tree Search variants, AI planning techniques, path integral Monte Carlo, simulated annealing, replica exchange) can be used to explore the space of short rule sequences to find low-$\Delta L_A$ or high-probability paths that break the pattern. This provides a theoretical estimate of stability based on the $L_A$ landscape and rule set.
            *   Analyzing simulation trajectories (MVU-2+): Observe how often patterns spontaneously break down or transform under normal AGE dynamics across many runs and correlate this with local conditions or $L_A$ values. The empirical decay rate (frequency of disappearance per unit time/step) is a direct measure of instability ($S \propto 1/\text{decay rate}$). The average lifetime of patterns across ensembles provides a statistical measure of $S$. This provides a probabilistic measure of stability, analogous to quantum decay probabilities, relating the abstract dynamics to observable lifetimes. This is the most promising method for large-scale statistical characterization of $S$. The distribution of lifetimes across ensembles provides a quantitative prediction to compare with experimental particle decay statistics, including branching ratios if different decay modes (different rule sequences leading to destruction) are observed and quantified.
            *   Multiverse/Ensemble Analysis (MVU-2+): The frequency of pattern recurrence, persistence duration, and average lifetime across many simulation runs under varied initial conditions provides a statistically robust empirical measure of the breadth and depth of its basin of attraction, which is statistically related to $S$. Patterns that emerge frequently and persist long are robust attractors with high $S$. This empirical distribution of lifetimes can be directly compared to experimental particle decay statistics, including branching ratios if different decay modes correspond to different rule sequences breaking the pattern. This provides the statistical prediction for pattern lifetimes. The robustness of a pattern to variations in initial conditions or the presence of other patterns in the ensemble is a strong indicator of its stability.
            *   Identifying minimal destructive rule sequences: Using search algorithms (e.g., A* search, graph search, AI planning) to find the shortest or lowest-$L_A$-cost sequence of rule applications from $\mathcal{R}$ that dismantles the pattern's structure or critical proto-properties. The cost/probability of this sequence approximates $\Delta E_{OC}$ and reveals potential "decay modes" – specific sequences of rules that lead to pattern breakdown, potentially mapping to particle decay channels with associated probabilities determined by the dynamics and the $L_A$ landscape. Branching ratios can be estimated from the relative probabilities or $L_A$ costs of different destructive sequences.

        *   **Implication:** A pattern's observed lifetime, decay probability, and interaction strength (cross-section) are direct measures of its inherent resilience to the dynamic transformations encoded in the Cosmic Algorithm and guided by $L_A$, reflecting the strength of its self-maintaining ontological closure against the background of dynamic rule applications. Highly stable patterns persist; unstable ones decay rapidly or transform. Interactions can be viewed as specific types of perturbations that overcome the pattern's $\Delta E_{OC}$ barrier in a controlled way, mediated by specific rule applications involving other patterns or relation types. The distribution of $S$ values for emergent patterns is a key prediction to compare with particle lifetimes (H1.3). The $S/C$ ratio in $L_A$ suggests that systems favor patterns that are maximally stable for their generative complexity/resource cost, potentially explaining why observed fundamental particles are highly stable or meta-stable relative to their complexity. There may be an emergent relationship between $C$ and $S$ that mirrors the mass-lifetime relationship of particles. The relationship between $S$ and emergent interaction strength could be related to the height of the $L_A$ barrier ($\Delta E_{OC}$) and the "width" or "steepness" of the $L_A$ landscape around the pattern's attractor basin, potentially linking to interaction cross-sections or coupling constants. Higher $S$ could imply lower interaction cross-section, making the pattern harder to disrupt. The probability distributions of decay modes and branching ratios are testable predictions.

    *   **Interaction Rules ($I_R$):** These are not fundamental AQNs of individual patterns but are emergent, effective descriptions of how instances of different $P_{ID}$ types transform each other or the surrounding graph structure when they co-occur in specific relational configurations (DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`). $I_R(P_{ID\_A}, P_{ID\_B} \to P_{ID\_C}, ...)$ describe processes analogous to binding, scattering, decay, annihilation, creation, and mediation of forces observed in physics. They are *derived computationally* by observing and statistically characterizing sequences of Cosmic Algorithm rule applications ($\{r_i\}$) that occur when instances of $P_{ID\_A}$ and $P_{ID\_B}$ are present in relational "proximity" (defined relationally, not spatially, e.g., by graph distance, shared neighborhood, specific connecting relations or motifs, or co-occurrence within a small, highly active graph region, or proximity in emergent spacetime - H1.5) or specific relational contexts, and which result in identifiable changes to these patterns (e.g., two patterns fusing into a composite pattern, one pattern decaying into others, patterns exchanging components or relations, patterns changing state in the presence of another, changes in relational structure between patterns, changes in their AQNs, emission of new patterns, changes in their emergent spacetime location/relation). Observed fundamental forces (Electromagnetism, Weak Nuclear, Strong Nuclear, and potentially Gravity) are hypothesized to be these emergent interaction patterns between specific fundamental $P_{ID}$s (analogues of leptons, quarks), potentially mediated by other specific $P_{ID}$s (analogues of force-carrying bosons) which facilitate specific rule applications between distant patterns by creating mediating relational structures, carrying proto-properties/information, or modifying the local graph dynamics. This requires a formal process of *coarse-graining* the underlying fine-grained GRS dynamics into effective interaction potentials, cross-sections, or reaction rules between emergent patterns (4.3.3 in AUTX-M1). Techniques from complex systems science (e.g., symbolic dynamics analysis of rule application sequences, process mining on simulation logs, information flow analysis), statistical physics (e.g., deriving effective potentials or Lagrangians from microscopic interactions, coarse-graining field theories defined on graphs, lattice field theory analogies), machine learning (e.g., training models to predict interaction outcomes or rates given pattern types and context, learning effective potentials or coupling constants from simulation data, using GNNs to predict interaction outcomes or coupling strengths based on local structure and pattern types, learning to predict scattering outcomes), or network science (e.g., analyzing information flow or influence between pattern instances, defining effective distance or coupling based on network structure/dynamics) could be used for this coarse-graining. The emergent $I_R$ should predict outcomes, rates, probabilities, and context-dependencies of interactions between $P_{ID}$s that match experimental data (H1.3, H1.4). Conservation laws (like charge, energy, momentum analogues, baryon/lepton number) are hypothesized to emerge from symmetries in these emergent $I_R$ and the underlying dynamics (e.g., if the total sum of a specific proto-property associated with an emergent charge is conserved across rule applications or pattern transformations, this corresponds to an emergent conservation law; if the $L_A$ function and $\mathcal{R}$ are invariant under certain transformations of the graph state that correspond to shifts in emergent momentum or energy, conservation laws might emerge; if the rule set respects symmetries of the proto-property algebra, conservation laws tied to that algebra emerge). The structure of the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ and the definition of proto-property semantics (including algebraic structures and conservation properties) are fundamental to which conservation laws emerge. Different rule types or specific proto-properties could mediate different force types; e.g., a rule that transfers a specific 'charge' proto-property or creates a specific 'charge-carrying' relation might lead to an electromagnetic-like interaction, while a rule that modifies internal structure based on 'color' proto-properties or creates 'color-carrying' relations might lead to a strong-force-like interaction. Rules that create/destroy specific relation types could be analogous to the emission/absorption of force carriers, where the relation instance *is* the force carrier analogue. The emergent $I_R$ are statistical descriptions of the coarse-grained micro-dynamics between patterns, including interaction cross-sections (related to the effective area or probability of interaction given proximity or relational configuration) and reaction probabilities (branching ratios for interaction outcomes). They should reproduce phenomena like scattering cross-sections, decay widths, binding energies, and the form of force potentials. The emergence of gauge symmetries or other fundamental symmetries in the emergent $I_R$ is a key test. The strength and range of emergent forces would be determined by the properties of the mediating relations/patterns and the rules governing their creation, destruction, and influence propagation, which are themselves determined by the configuration. The derived $I_R$ should form a consistent effective theory at the emergent level, potentially approximating a quantum field theory or a force law like electromagnetism or gravity in the appropriate limits.

3.  **DC3 (Ontological Closure - OC):** A state achieved by a pattern ($P_{ID}$) or a larger subgraph when its internal attributed structure and its relational context within the global graph $G_t$ constitute a dynamically self-consistent and self-maintaining configuration (DC3 in `D-P6.2-4`). This means the pattern is a robust local optimum or attractor under the $L_A$-driven AGE dynamics. Rule applications from the Cosmic Algorithm in the vicinity of the pattern instance tend to preserve, reinforce, or quickly restore its structure and properties, or deviations are counteracted by the dynamics, potentially via specific "repair" or "stabilization" rules implicitly or explicitly favored by $L_A$. OC is the qualitative state of being a dynamically stable, self-maintaining entity within the relational substrate, resilient to the system's inherent dynamism and the continuous application of rules. High $S$ is the quantitative measure of the strength of this OC, representing the depth of its attractor basin ($\Delta E_{OC}$) or its empirical persistence. Patterns with strong OC are the dynamically stable building blocks from which more complex, hierarchical structures can emerge and persist. OC is not a static property but a dynamic process of continuous self-constitution against the background of change, driven by the local $L_A$ optimization which favors states where these coherent structures are maintained. It is analogous to a self-repairing, homeostatic, or autocatalytic system, where the pattern's structure and properties enable the very rule applications needed to maintain or restore it by making the resulting states high in $L_A$. Emergent entities exist by virtue of their ability to self-maintain their relational identity against the background dynamics, effectively carving out a region of stability in the turbulent state space. Ontological Closure implies that the pattern is a fixed point or limit cycle not just structurally, but also in terms of its attributed state and its ability to resist typical perturbations from the surrounding dynamics, quantified by $\Delta E_{OC}$. The degree of OC can vary, leading to a spectrum of stabilities from highly stable fundamental patterns to transient, unstable configurations. The v1.0 prototype demonstrated a minimal form of OC based on structural consistency under a single rule as a *filter*; v2.0 expands this to dynamic stability under a rich rule set driven by $L_A$ optimization and incorporating attributes as a *generative principle*. OC is the mechanism by which stable "objects" emerge from a dynamic, relational process. It is the computational realization of the philosophical idea that existence is tied to self-constitution and resilience. It represents the self-organization of the substrate into persistent, identifiable forms. The concept of OC also extends to larger structures or even the entire graph, representing a form of global stability or cosmic coherence.

4.  **DC4 (The Exploration Drive):** A hypothesized emergent meta-principle or a specific set of mechanisms implemented within the $L_A$ function or the rule selection process (P3) designed to counteract the natural tendency for purely greedy local $L_A$ maximization to quickly converge to simple, low-$L_A$, homogeneous, or stagnant local optima, especially in early or low-complexity states of the graph (DC4 in `D-P6.2-4`). This drive is necessary to explain the emergence of the universe's observed complexity, diversity, and potentially large-scale structure, which may require transient decreases in $L_A$ or non-obvious state transitions to discover and reach higher-peak, more complex, globally favorable stable patterns and regions in the vast $L_A$ fitness landscape. Without it, the system might get stuck in a trivial "dead" state (e.g., a simple, highly ordered but low-$L_A$ graph with no potential for further complex evolution), failing to explore the potential for richer, more complex existence. The Exploration Drive introduces a mechanism for escaping local minima and discovering new, potentially more fruitful areas of the state space. This drive could potentially be linked to the observed quantum fluctuations or the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, providing a mechanism for the universe to explore potential futures beyond the classically deterministic path of maximal fitness increase. It ensures the system doesn't get stuck in simple, uninteresting configurations and can discover the complex, highly fit configurations that correspond to observed reality. This is crucial for explaining the universe's observed richness and the existence of complex structures like life. It provides a mechanism for "creativity" or "innovation" in the cosmic evolution. It biases the system towards novelty and complexity, while still being guided by the fitness function. This can be viewed as a computational implementation of a principle of "sufficient reason" or a drive towards realizing potential complexity.
    *   Potential mechanisms for implementing the Exploration Drive within the computational model (often implemented as part of the selection function $f$ in P3 or as specific rules):
        *   **Stochastic Selection:** Introducing a controlled probability distribution over the set of possible immediate successor states $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$, where the probability of selecting $G'$ is a function of $L_A(G')$, but not necessarily a Dirac delta function at the maximum (P3, DC4 in `D-P6.2-4`, 3.1.2 in AUTX-M1). Examples: Boltzmann distribution ($P(G' | G_t) \propto \exp(\beta L_A(G'))$), where $\beta$ is a parameter analogous to inverse temperature, controlling the degree of randomness (high $\beta \implies$ more greedy; low $\beta \implies$ more random, exploring lower $L_A$ states). This allows lower-$L_A$ states to be selected with non-zero probability, enabling the system to "jump" out of local $L_A$ minima and explore states that are not immediately optimal but might lead to higher $L_A$ states later. $\beta$ could be fixed or could be a dynamic parameter of the system, potentially evolving over cosmic time (e.g., decreasing like an annealing schedule, leading to less exploration and more exploitation as the universe "cools" or matures, potentially linking to the thermodynamic arrow of time or phase transitions, or dependent on global metrics like graph density or average $L_A$). Other distributions (e.g., power-law distributions, rank-weighted distributions, Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein like distributions based on $L_A$ "energy levels") could also be used, potentially linking to statistical mechanics formalisms. The probabilistic nature of this selection might be the origin of quantum probability, with the wave function potentially related to the probability distribution over possible graph states or transformation sequences in $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$, or over possible outcomes of specific rule applications, providing a generative model for quantum randomness and fluctuations. The probability distribution could also be dependent on specific properties of the current state $G_t$ or the rules being applied, for instance, favoring rules that lead to novel states under certain conditions. This provides a concrete computational model for the origin of quantum probability at the fundamental level.
        *   **$\epsilon$-Greedy Selection:** With probability $1-\epsilon$, select the state with maximum $L_A$; with probability $\epsilon$, select a random state from $\mathcal{P}(G_t)$ (or a random state from a subset of high-$L_A$ states, or a random state generated by a specific set of "exploratory" rules, or a state with high novelty/diversity score). $\epsilon$ controls the level of random exploration and could also be a dynamic parameter, potentially decreasing over time or dependent on global state properties.
        *   **Rank-Based Selection:** Select probabilistically from the top-k $L_A$ scoring states, with probabilities potentially weighted by rank or $L_A$ value (e.g., favoring the top states but giving others a chance).
        *   **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Instead of a single scalar $L_A$, the selection could be based on optimizing multiple criteria simultaneously (e.g., maximizing $L_A$, maximizing novelty, minimizing resource cost, maximizing diversity), using techniques from multi-objective optimization. Some criteria might favor stability, others complexity, and others exploration or diversity, with the selection involving finding Pareto optimal states or using a weighted combination that isn't a simple sum, allowing for trade-offs between competing fitness goals (e.g., maximizing stability AND diversity, even if they are in tension). The selection principle could prioritize potential for future $L_A$ growth as well as current $L_A$. This requires defining vector-valued objective functions and a selection rule based on Pareto dominance or weighted sums.
        *   **Rule-Specific Selection Bias:** Some rules in $\mathcal{R}$ might have an inherent selection bias (a "propensity" or "weight") independent of or modifying their $L_A$ contribution, especially if they represent rare processes or interactions with hypothetical background fields (though in Autaxys, these biases should ideally emerge from the $L_A$ dynamics or context conditions).
        *   **Context-Dependent Stochasticity:** The level of stochasticity or the specific probabilistic selection mechanism might depend on the local or global context of the graph state $G_t$, for example, being higher in regions of low $L_A$, low pattern density, or high structural disorder, or lower in regions of high $L_A$ or high pattern stability. This could link to concepts like vacuum fluctuations or phase transitions.
    *   The specific mechanism for handling ties and incorporating exploration (as part of DC4) is a critical parameterizable component of the Autaxys Configuration under investigation (4.1.4.4 in AUTX-M1), impacting the system's ability to discover and settle into complex attractors. This selection process, repeated at each step, forms the deterministic (or probabilistic) time evolution $G_t \to G_{t+1}$. The integrated Autaxic Action $A_A = \sum_{t=0}^{N} L_A(G_t)$ over a history is a consequence of this local rule, not necessarily the primary optimization target over long time horizons in the greedy model, although maximizing local $L_A$ is hypothesized to generally lead towards trajectories with higher total $A_A$ or towards high-$L_A$ attractor states. The long-term behavior is dominated by the attractor landscape shaped by $L_A$ and $\mathcal{R}$, and the Exploration Drive determines how effectively this landscape is explored and which attractors are reached. The selection principle is the "engine" that drives the system through the state space according to the landscape defined by $L_A$ and the rules. The probabilistic selection mechanism, if used, offers a concrete computational model for the origin of quantum probability and fluctuations at the most fundamental level, where the universe "chooses" among possible next states with probabilities related to their "fitness." This provides a generative explanation for quantum randomness. This selection process provides the fundamental 'time' dimension of the universe, where each step is a discrete unit of change.

**Central Hypothesis (H1):**

> **H1:** Given a sufficiently simple, minimal, and well-defined initial configuration (comprising a finite set of Proto-property spaces $\Pi_D, \Pi_R$ with defined semantics and potential algebraic structures, a minimal, finite Cosmic Algorithm $\mathcal{R} = \{r_i\}$ consisting of attributed graph rewrite rules, and a computable Autaxic Lagrangian $L_A(G)$ embodying the Economy of Existence and robustly incorporating an Exploration Drive mechanism DC4), the iterative application of the local $L_A$-maximization (or $L_A$-dependent probabilistic) dynamic (P3) to an initially simple or random graph state $G_0$ will spontaneously and robustly generate a non-trivial diversity of stable, meta-stable, and interacting emergent patterns ($P_{ID}$s). These patterns will be characterized by specific, computationally derivable Autaxic Quantum Numbers (AQNs: $C, T, S$) and emergent Interaction Rules ($I_R$), constituting an increasingly complex, organized, and ordered macroscopic state. Furthermore, through a systematic, iterative process of computational simulation, analysis of emergent phenomena, and refinement of the initial configuration guided by rigorous empirical comparison with observed physical reality (as filtered through ANWOS), it is hypothesized that a specific, parsimonious Autaxys Configuration exists and can be identified whose generated pattern landscape (the set of robustly emergent $P_{ID}$s, their statistical AQN properties, and their emergent $I_R$), along with the emergent large-scale structure and dynamics (H1.5), will quantitatively and qualitatively resemble observed physical reality, including fundamental particles (Standard Model and potentially beyond), fundamental forces (Electromagnetism, Weak Nuclear, Strong Nuclear, and potentially Gravity), and the large-scale structure and dynamics of spacetime (cosmology, gravity). This implies that the fundamental nature of the universe, its constituents, laws, and structure, is a direct, emergent consequence of a simple, optimization-driven generative process on a relational substrate, rather than being imposed by external, pre-existing laws or fundamental entities. The universe, in this view, is the most "fit" or "aesthetically pleasing" outcome of a fundamental computational process, favored by the dynamics and discovered through a process of driven exploration. This is a hypothesis about the "source code" of reality, proposing it is a generative algorithm guided by a fitness function, and that the observed universe is a highly probable or dominant outcome of this algorithm's execution within the $L_A$ landscape. The search for this specific configuration is the primary scientific objective of the Autaxys program.

**Corollaries (Testable Implications of H1):**

*   **H1.1 (Emergence of Order and Structure):** The system's evolution, driven by local $L_A$ maximization (and influenced by the Exploration Drive), will exhibit a macroscopic trend towards states of higher average and aggregate $L_A$ over sufficiently long durations, despite potential transient local decreases (facilitated by the Exploration Drive). This implies a form of emergent self-organization and complexity science where $L_A$ acts as a potential function or fitness landscape guiding the system's trajectory from less structured, lower $L_A$ states (potentially high local entropy of distinctions/relations, but low organizational complexity) towards more structured, higher $L_A$ states characterized by the persistent presence, coherent interaction, and hierarchical organization of stable $P_{ID}$s. This emergent trend suggests an intrinsic arrow of time tied to the increase in organizational fitness and complexity, potentially explaining the thermodynamic arrow of time as a coarse-grained manifestation of the underlying $L_A$ dynamics, where the increase in thermodynamic entropy in spacetime might be coupled to the increase in structural complexity, pattern organization, and information content in the underlying graph, or to the rate of information processing within the system. $L_A$ increase might also be linked to the concept of negentropy or structural complexity growth, or to the emergence of computationally complex structures. The initial state $G_0$ might correspond to a state of minimal structure or maximal "potential for $L_A$ increase" or maximal exploratory potential. The dynamics are hypothesized to naturally move towards states of greater information content, organization, and coherence, counteracting simple entropic decay towards structural homogeneity or maximal undirected entropy, driven by the $L_A$ function's preference for complexity, stability, diversity, and structured relationships. This emergent ordering is a key prediction of the framework, suggesting a fundamental principle of self-organization inherent in the substrate. The rate of $L_A$ increase or the rate of state space exploration might also be linked to cosmological parameters like the Hubble constant, the scale of inflation, or the rate of dark energy expansion. The direction of time's arrow could also be tied to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ or the $L_A$ function (e.g., if rules are not reversible, or if $L_A$ penalizes states reachable by reversing high-$L_A$ transitions), or to the probabilistic nature of the selection process (P3/DC4), or to the emergent causal structure (H1.5). The emergence of distinct phases in the universe's evolution (e.g., inflationary epoch, symmetry breaking phase transitions, structure formation era, periods dominated by specific rule types or pattern interactions) should be observed in simulation trajectories as periods with distinct dynamical behaviors, dominant rule applications/pattern types, or changes in global graph metrics, linked to changes in global $L_A$, transitions between attractor basins in the $L_A$ landscape, or changes in the parameters of the Exploration Drive (e.g., decreasing $\beta$ or $\epsilon$). The framework predicts that the universe's history is a trajectory through the $L_A$ landscape, guided by optimization and exploration, leading to the observed complex structures and thermodynamic arrow of time.

*   **H1.2 (Derivation of the Autaxic Table):** The set of all robustly emergent $P_{ID}$s identified across a sufficient exploration of the system's state space under a specific Autaxys Configuration (e.g., via extensive multiverse simulation as defined in MVU-2+), along with their statistically characterized, computationally derived AQNs ($C, T, S$) and emergent Interaction Rules ($I_R$), will form a self-generated "Autaxic Table of Patterns." This table is the framework's analogue to the Standard Model of particle physics and its associated force interactions, but its entries are *derived* from the generative process, not postulated as fundamental. The statistical distributions of AQNs for each $P_{ID}$ type observed across the ensemble provide the predicted quantitative properties (e.g., mean mass, variance in charge, distribution of spin values, range of lifetimes, correlations between properties, decay branching ratios, effective coupling constants, scattering cross-sections) for the emergent particles/entities, including potential relationships or correlations between different AQNs for a given pattern type (e.g., a relationship between $C$ and $S$ that resembles mass-lifetime relationships, or correlations between $C$ and $T$ like mass-charge ratios, or relations between $T$ and $I_R$ like charge determining interaction type/strength, or relations between $C$ and $I_R$ like mass influencing interaction cross-section). The table will also include the derived $I_R$ describing how these patterns interact (e.g., reaction probabilities, effective coupling constants, decay modes, branching ratios, scattering cross-sections, conservation laws associated with specific interactions, symmetry breaking patterns, force carrier identities and properties, range and form of effective potentials derived from relational dynamics). This provides a theoretical table of fundamental constituents and their properties that is testable against empirical observation. The statistical nature of the derived properties is a key feature, aligning with the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, and provides a basis for quantitative statistical comparison with experimental data. The table should ideally predict the hierarchy of masses, the spectrum of charges and spins, the relative stabilities, and the interaction strengths of observed fundamental particles and forces, and potentially predict new ones. The table will also include information on composite patterns and their constituent fundamental patterns, revealing the hierarchical structure of emergent reality (e.g., how protons/neutrons emerge as composites of quark analogues, how atoms emerge as composites of nucleon and electron analogues). The emergence of fundamental constants (like particle masses, coupling constants, mixing angles, potentially even $\hbar, c, G$ as ratios of emergent properties or parameters of the configuration) as specific values derived from the configuration's dynamics and parameters is a key prediction captured in the table. The table should also include predictions for predicted but unobserved patterns (e.g., dark matter candidates with specific AQNs and $I_R$, new force carriers, exotic composite states, signatures of topological defects) along with their predicted AQNs and $I_R$. The process of populating this table involves computationally identifying patterns, classifying them into types, computing their AQNs and $I_R$ by analyzing their structure and behavior across many simulation steps and ensemble runs, and statistically characterizing their properties. This requires sophisticated data analysis pipelines (DC1, DC2 in `D-P6.2-4`, 4.1.2.3 in AUTX-M1). The table serves as the direct bridge between the abstract Autaxys configuration and the observable universe, providing the specific predictions to be validated against empirical data.

*   **H1.3 (Connection to Physics - Empirical Validation):** Through a systematic, iterative process of computational simulation (MVU-n, progressing from MVU-1 and MVU-2 to more complex simulations with richer $\Pi, \mathcal{R}, L_A$), detailed analysis of emergent phenomena (patterns, AQNs, $I_R$, emergent large-scale structure, emergent spacetime properties, emergent quantum phenomena, emergent conservation laws, emergent thermodynamic properties), and rigorous quantitative comparison with empirical data from physics (particle properties from accelerators/detectors - masses, charges, spins, lifetimes, decay modes, branching ratios, magnetic moments, form factors, scattering cross-sections, mixing angles, cross-sections for various interactions, properties of neutrinos, Higgs boson properties; observed fundamental forces and conservation laws - strength, range, symmetry properties, mediated particles; cosmological structure from surveys/CMB - LSS power spectrum, CMB anisotropies, Hubble constant, baryon acoustic oscillations, galaxy/cluster distributions, cosmic web topology, dark matter distribution and properties; spacetime properties inferred from astronomical measurements - gravitational lensing, black hole properties, gravitational waves, universality of free fall, tests of GR, observed spacetime dimensionality, cosmological parameters like dark energy density and equation of state, cosmological constant value, inflationary parameters; specific experimental results like scattering experiments, particle decay chains, high-energy collision outcomes, precision measurements of fundamental constants, searches for new particles, tests of fundamental symmetries like CPT or Lorentz invariance, tests of quantum entanglement across distances), the Autaxys Configuration ($\Pi_D, \Pi_R, \mathcal{R}, L_A(G), G_0$, and parameters of the Exploration Drive) will be iteratively refined (4.1.4 in AUTX-M1). The hypothesis predicts that a specific, parsimonious configuration exists such that the properties (statistical distributions of AQNs) and emergent interaction rules ($I_R$) of the most stable, frequent, and energetically favorable $P_{ID}$s generated by the framework will quantitatively and qualitatively correspond to the observed properties and interactions of fundamental particles (leptons, quarks, force carriers, neutrinos, Higgs boson, potentially dark matter/energy candidates, gravitons) and forces (electromagnetism, weak nuclear, strong nuclear, and potentially gravity) in the physical universe. Furthermore, the emergent large-scale structure and dynamics of the graph should match observed cosmology. This provides a direct path for empirical validation and potential falsification of specific configurations and the overall framework. The ability to reproduce known physics with a parsimonious configuration (measured by the complexity of $\Pi, \mathcal{R}, L_A$ - see 5.2 in AUTX-M1) and high statistical fidelity is the primary benchmark for scientific viability. Parsimony in this context means a configuration with minimal complexity in its definition: small $\Pi_D, \Pi_R$, small number of rules in $\mathcal{R}$, simple structure of rules, and a simple functional form for $L_A$ with few parameters. This aligns with the philosophical preference for Ockham's Razor – the simplest generative principles that produce the observed complexity are preferred. This involves comparing statistical distributions of emergent properties to experimental measurements, including error bars and confidence intervals, using standard statistical tests (e.g., $\chi^2$ tests, goodness-of-fit tests, likelihood comparisons, Bayesian model comparison, comparing distributions using statistical distance measures like Wasserstein distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, or comparing moments like mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis). The framework must explain the values of fundamental constants (like $\hbar, c, G$, coupling constants, particle masses, mixing angles) as emergent properties or parameters derived from the configuration's dynamics and parameters, which should ideally be few in number and simple in form in the fundamental configuration. It must also reproduce emergent conservation laws and symmetries observed in physics (e.g., conservation of energy-momentum, charge, baryon/lepton number, color charge, lepton flavor, CPT symmetry, Lorentz invariance, gauge symmetries, internal symmetries like flavor or isospin symmetry). The emergence of these symmetries and conservation laws from the algebraic structure of proto-properties and the symmetry properties of $\mathcal{R}$ and $L_A$ is a key prediction. The goal is to find the minimal generative principles that predict the observed universe. This requires defining clear mappings between computational outputs (graph metrics, AQN distributions, rule application statistics, emergent relational structures, emergent causal structure, emergent metric properties, statistical properties of emergent pattern interactions) and empirical observables (particle masses, cross-sections, cosmological parameters, spacetime curvature, etc.). The statistical comparison should be quantitative and rigorous. Failure to find such a configuration after extensive, systematic search within a reasonable space of simple configurations would constitute strong evidence against the Autaxys hypothesis.

*   **H1.4 (Predictive Power):** Once an Autaxys configuration is identified through the iterative refinement process that successfully reproduces a significant portion of known physics (H1.3) with high fidelity and parsimony, the framework becomes a predictive scientific tool. It can be used to predict the existence and properties (AQNs) of new, as yet unobserved stable or meta-stable patterns ($P_{ID}$s) that are robust attractors of the configuration but haven't been detected experimentally (e.g., new particles beyond the Standard Model, composite structures, topological defects, signatures of emergent fields, specific types of dark matter particles or dark energy behavior with specific interaction properties and mass ranges, particles predicted by emergent symmetries or conservation laws, potential constituents of spacetime foam at Planck scale, entities involved in symmetry breaking phase transitions). It can predict the outcomes and rates of interactions ($I_R$) at energy scales or under conditions not yet probed experimentally (e.g., high-energy scattering outcomes, behavior in extreme environments like black hole interiors, neutron stars, or early universe conditions, interactions between known particles and predicted new patterns, precise values for coupling constants or mixing angles, specific decay chains and branching ratios for rare or exotic processes, predictions for neutrino oscillations or sterile neutrinos). It can predict novel emergent phenomena ($I_R$, spacetime properties, cosmological features, phase transitions in the structure of reality, specific features of emergent gravity or quantum behavior, violations or modifications of assumed principles like Lorentz invariance or locality at fundamental scales, specific signatures in gravitational wave data (e.g., deviations from expected waveforms based on GR) or CMB (e.g., non-Gaussianities, specific power spectrum anomalies), specific forms of non-locality or entanglement that differ from current predictions, constraints on the behavior of dark matter/energy, predictions for proton decay or other currently unobserved decays, potential for emergent higher dimensions or complex spacetime topologies at microscopic scales). These predictions provide concrete, testable targets for future experiments in particle physics (e.g., LHC upgrades, future colliders, dark matter detectors, neutrino experiments), cosmology (e.g., next-generation telescopes, CMB experiments, galaxy surveys), astrophysics (e.g., gravitational wave detectors, black hole observations, cosmic ray physics), and potentially other fields. Falsification of these predictions (e.g., failure to discover a predicted particle with specified properties within experimental reach, observation of phenomena incompatible with predicted emergent spacetime properties or cosmological features, experimental results that contradict predicted interaction outcomes or rates, detection of specific violations of fundamental symmetries or locality that are not predicted by the configuration) would rule out the specific configuration and provide guidance for further refinement or potential rejection of the overall hypothesis if no simple, reality-matching configuration can be found after extensive search. The framework must predict the *statistical distributions* of properties and interactions, reflecting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, and these distributions must match experimental observations within statistical uncertainties. The ability to make successful *novel* predictions beyond the data used for tuning is the hallmark of a successful scientific theory. The framework should also be able to provide postdictions for existing puzzles not explicitly used in tuning (e.g., the hierarchy problem, neutrino masses and mixing, the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the cosmological constant problem, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the origin of inflation) by showing that these are natural, emergent consequences of the identified configuration's dynamics. The goal is to move from fitting existing data to making new, falsifiable predictions that distinguish Autaxys from other theoretical frameworks.

*   **H1.5 (Emergence of Spacetime):** Spacetime itself, with its observed dimensionality (3 spatial, 1 temporal), metric structure (defining distances and durations), causal relationships, and dynamics (e.g., curvature, expansion, speed of light, gravitational phenomena), is hypothesized to be an emergent, macroscopic, and coarse-grained property of the relational graph dynamics, not a pre-existing arena or fundamental entity (H1.5 in `D-P6.2-4`). Properties analogous to spatial distance, temporal duration, causality, and metric coefficients are expected to arise from the large-scale structure, connectivity patterns, dynamics of rule application (including its locality, sequence, potential for parallel application, and rate), and specific types of relations and their transformations within the evolving ARG, particularly as mediated by specific $P_{ID}$s (potentially gravitational analogues) or global graph properties. The structure and dynamics of spacetime are thus intimately tied to the collective behavior of emergent patterns and their interactions, potentially exhibiting discrete, non-manifold, fractal, or fundamentally relational properties at the most fundamental scales before coarse-graining into the continuum spacetime of General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory at larger scales. Spacetime is a property of the organization of the fundamental relational substrate, not a separate container.
    *   **Emergent Causality/Time:** The discrete, sequential nature of rule applications (P2, P3) provides a fundamental ordering, defining a discrete "cosmic time step." The directed nature of relations (P1) and the way rules propagate influence across the graph (e.g., a rule application at node A affecting node B via relation A->B) can give rise to an emergent causal structure, where an event at A causally precedes an event at B if there is a directed path of rule-mediated influence from A to B. A relation $(u, v)$ might imply $u$ influences $v$, and a rule application involving $u$ might causally precede effects on $v$. The sequence of rule applications defines the fundamental timeline. Macroscopic, continuous time emerges from the aggregate effect, ordering, and rate of these microscopic causal steps across the entire graph. The direction of the emergent arrow of time might be linked to the macroscopic increase in $L_A$ (H1.1), the increase in complexity ($C$), or the increasing number/stability of $P_{ID}$s, suggesting a connection between cosmic evolution, complexity, and the perception of time's flow. Time might be better understood as a measure of accumulated change or computational steps in the substrate, or as a dimension orthogonal to the state space defined by rule application sequences. The rate of emergent time might vary across different regions of the graph depending on local activity, rule application rates, or structure, potentially linking to concepts of time dilation or the relationship between time and energy (as in relativistic time dilation near massive objects or in strong gravitational fields, which are themselves emergent patterns with high $C$ or specific $T$ properties that influence local dynamics). The causal structure of the graph could converge to a causal set structure at large scales, where fundamental events are related only by causality. The speed of light might emerge as a maximum rate of information propagation or causal influence across the graph, limited by the discrete steps and the "length" of relational paths (e.g., the maximum speed at which a pattern can 'move' or influence another through a sequence of rule applications or relation traversals), or limited by the rate of rule application and the minimum number of relational steps required for influence propagation. The arrow of time could also be tied to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ or the $L_A$ function, or to the probabilistic nature of the selection process, or to the emergent causal structure (H1.5). The emergence of time as a one-dimensional flow from an underlying discrete, relational process is a key prediction.

    *   **Emergent Space/Distance:** Spatial distance is hypothesized to emerge not as a fundamental property of a background manifold, but from the relational structure of the graph (H1.5 in `D-P6.2-4`). Relational "proximity" or "distance" between two distinctions or patterns might be defined by:
        *   **Graph Distance:** The shortest path length (number of edges) between their corresponding nodes/subgraphs in the ARG. This provides a discrete distance measure.
        *   **Number or Type of Connecting Relations:** The existence, number, or proto-properties of relations linking them directly or indirectly. Specific relation types might act as "spatial bonds" or "metric links," their properties defining the "length" of the connection or their density influencing the effective metric in a region.
        *   **Strength/Frequency of Interaction ($I_R$):** Patterns that interact frequently or strongly might be considered "closer" in an emergent space. The probability or rate of interaction between patterns could define an effective distance metric, inversely proportional to distance.
        *   **Shared Context/Neighbors:** Patterns sharing many common neighbors or being part of the same dense subgraph/community might be considered proximate. Measures of network similarity or community structure could define distance.
        *   **Information Distance:** The minimum number of fundamental operations (rule applications) or information transfer cost required to propagate influence or information between two points in the graph.
        *   **Resistance Distance:** A metric based on electrical resistance in a circuit analogy, where edges are resistors (potentially weighted by relation properties). This can capture global connectivity.
        *   **Effective Metric from Dynamics:** A metric derived from the dynamics of information flow, diffusion processes, or pattern propagation on the graph (e.g., using random walks, diffusion kernels, or analyzing the dynamics of specific wave-like patterns on the graph).
        *   **Curvature Measures:** Measures of discrete curvature on the graph (e.g., Ollivier-Ricci curvature, Forman-Ricci curvature, or other discrete curvature definitions) can provide local geometric information.
        *   A graph metric could be defined on the set of nodes or patterns based on these relational measures, and this metric structure could approximate a continuous spatial metric at large scales. The "dimensionality" of emergent space could arise from graph dimensions (e.g., embedding dimension into a low-dimensional metric space that minimizes distortion, fractal dimension of the graph based on volume growth, spectral dimension of graph Laplacians, growth rate of graph volume with graph distance, or the number of independent directions of propagation for certain patterns/interactions or information flow, or related to the algebraic structure of proto-properties or rules, or related to the structure of the emergent causal set, or dimension measures from persistent homology, or the number of independent directions in the space of relational correlations). Specific relation types or patterns might act as 'metric carriers', defining the local "size" or "distance" scale by their properties or frequency. The perceived 3+1 dimensions of spacetime could be the dimensionality of the dominant, stable emergent structure or relation types that constitute the background for particle interactions, potentially arising from specific algebraic properties of proto-properties or symmetries of the rule set $\mathcal{R}$ or $L_A$ that favor the formation of structures with these dimensional characteristics (e.g., maximizing $L_A$ for structures that allow efficient, non-redundant connections or information flow in 3+1 dimensions, or where $3+1$ dimensions are a preferred, high-$L_A$ attractor in the space of possible emergent dimensionalities). The topology of emergent space (e.g., curvature, connectivity, presence of wormholes or extra dimensions at small scales) would be determined by the graph's large-scale structure and dynamics. The emergence of specific spatial dimensions (e.g., 3+1) as a preferred emergent property is a key prediction.

    *   **Emergent Spacetime Dynamics & Gravity:** Gravity is hypothesized to be an emergent force ($I_R$) arising from the collective dynamics of specific patterns (potentially gravitational analogues, e.g., patterns with high $C$ or specific $T$ properties that strongly influence the relational structure) and their influence on the large-scale relational structure, which is perceived as spacetime curvature (H1.5 in `D-P6.2-4`). Changes in the density or configuration of these patterns could alter the local 'relational metric' defined by the graph structure/dynamics (e.g., changing connectivity density, type/frequency of 'metric-carrying' relations, rate of rule application in a region, information flow capacity, local graph spectral properties, local discrete curvature), leading to effects analogous to gravitational attraction or spacetime warping. The dynamics of the graph at large scales (e.g., overall growth rate, connectivity changes, phase transitions, formation of dense or sparse regions, changes in effective dimensionality, large-scale symmetries or symmetry breaking) could correspond to cosmological phenomena like expansion or contraction. The speed of light might emerge as a maximum rate of information propagation or causal influence across the graph, limited by the discrete steps and the "length" of relational paths (e.g., the maximum speed at which a pattern can 'move' or influence another through a sequence of rule applications or relation traversals). Entanglement and non-locality might be naturally represented by specific, non-local relational structures or proto-property correlations that persist across large graph distances or are established by specific rules (e.g., rules creating paired nodes/edges far apart with correlated properties) or favored by the $L_A$ principle (e.g., $L_A$ terms rewarding specific types of non-local correlation), and whose behavior cannot be explained by emergent local spacetime alone, suggesting the underlying substrate is fundamentally non-spatial or exists in an emergent space with more complex topology or higher dimensionality at the fundamental level. Quantum non-locality might be a direct manifestation of the underlying graph structure not being embedded in a simple manifold, or of correlations established by rules or the $L_A$ principle that transcend local emergent spacetime.

    *   Deriving the specific properties of observed spacetime (Lorentz invariance, the form of the metric tensor, Einstein's field equations as effective equations) from the underlying graph dynamics and emergent patterns is a major long-term goal requiring sophisticated techniques for coarse-graining discrete graph structures and dynamics into continuum field theories or effective force laws. This requires identifying the macroscopic observables of the graph that correspond to metric components and stress-energy tensors and showing that their dynamics approximate Einstein's equations or their quantum gravity counterparts. This could involve applying techniques from statistical mechanics of networks, coarse-graining of graph rewriting systems, or deriving effective field theories from the underlying discrete dynamics, potentially using methods from geometric graph theory, network dynamics, information geometry, discrete differential geometry on graphs, or methods from condensed matter physics or lattice field theory adapted to dynamic attributed graphs. The emergence of Lorentz invariance as a symmetry of the emergent $I_R$ and spacetime dynamics at high effective speeds is a key prediction. The framework aims to explain gravity as an emergent phenomenon arising from the dynamics of the relational substrate and the distribution of emergent patterns within it. The metric tensor could be an emergent property related to the density and type of specific relation types or patterns in a region. Einstein's field equations might emerge as effective equations describing the dynamics of this emergent metric as influenced by the distribution and dynamics of other emergent patterns (matter/energy analogues). Black holes and gravitational waves would be emergent phenomena in the large-scale graph dynamics, potentially related to specific topological features, dynamic events in the graph structure (e.g., regions of extremely high density or rule application rate, topological phase transitions), or specific interactions between dense pattern concentrations. The framework should explain the geometric nature of gravity and its link to energy/momentum. The relationship between the emergent spacetime properties and the emergent quantum properties ($L_A$ terms $\Lambda_{spacetime}, \Lambda_{quantum}$) is critical, aiming to show that quantum mechanics and gravity are not fundamentally separate forces but different emergent aspects of the same underlying relational dynamics, potentially unifying them at the most fundamental level via the structure of the graph, rules, and $L_A$. This could involve showing that the emergent metric field is quantized in some sense, or that quantum effects arise from the discrete, relational nature of the underlying substrate that gives rise to both. The challenge includes deriving the quantum behavior of emergent gravity and the gravitational influence on emergent quantum particles.
