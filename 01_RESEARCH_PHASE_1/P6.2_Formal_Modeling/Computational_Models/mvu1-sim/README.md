# Autaxys Generative Engine: The Definitive Research Instrument

**Version: 9.0 (Definitive, Law-Emergent, S-Level Maximization Engine with Exploration Drive)**

## 1. Overview

This project is the definitive, self-contained instrument for simulating and analyzing the Autaxys framework. It has been re-architected to meet the highest standards of scientific and philosophical rigor. It embodies the principle of **true self-generation**.

**There are no hardcoded physical constants or arbitrary parameters.** The simulation starts from a true void and evolves based on a single, fundamental drive: **to maximize its own Ontological Closure (S-Level).**

## 2. The Scientific Framework

### 2.1. Core Hypothesis
> Can a system, starting from nothing and governed only by a drive to achieve more robust and complex forms of self-consistency, spontaneously generate the hierarchical structures and dynamic laws we observe in reality?

### 2.2. The Evolution of the Model: A Commitment to Intellectual Honesty

This model is the result of a rigorous iterative process. Initial, flawed versions contained "magic numbers" and simplistic logic that led to premature halting or trivial results. The final version incorporates several key principles developed to overcome these limitations:

*   **No Magic Numbers:** All external physical constants have been removed.
*   **S-Level Maximization:** The simulation's core driver is a multi-objective function that seeks to maximize the Ontological Closure level (S-Level) of the system, then its robustness, while minimizing its complexity (The Economy of Existence).
*   **The Eternal Return:** A universe that collapses to nothing is considered a failed attempt. The simulation automatically re-ignites from the persistent Vacuum.
*   **Emergent Properties & Laws:** Core particle properties (`valence`) and even the effectiveness of the rules themselves (`ruleWeights`) are dynamic and emerge from the simulation's history and state.

### 2.3. New Speculative Principle Under Test: The Exploration Drive

This version introduces and tests a significant, speculative extension to the Autaxys framework.

*   **The Problem:** A purely "greedy" optimization algorithm is too conservative to build true complexity, as it cannot make a "strategic sacrifice" (a temporarily suboptimal move) for a greater future gain.
*   **The Hypothesis (The Exploration Drive):** A truly self-generating system must employ a dual-process dynamic.
    1.  **Optimization (Fast Thinking):** The default drive to choose the move that provides the greatest immediate increase in coherence.
    2.  **Exploration (Slow Thinking):** A stochastic drive, most active in low-complexity states, that allows the system to take "risky" moves that are not immediately optimal.
*   **Implications:** This suggests the universe possesses a rudimentary form of **memory** (basing its "risk tolerance" on its current state) and **foresight** (making a short-term sacrifice for a potential long-term gain). This workbench is designed to test if this dual-process model is a necessary component for the emergence of complex structures.

### 2.4. Scientific Rigor
*   **Dynamic Batch Analysis:** The number of stochastic runs is not fixed. The analysis controller runs simulations in increments until the results converge and a 95% statistical confidence interval on the mean final S-Level is achieved.
*   **Weighted Averaging:** The final aggregated plot is weighted to give more significance to runs that achieve higher levels of complexity and stability.
*   **Error Analysis:** The methodology is explicitly designed to minimize Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) errors.

## 3. How to Use the Workbench

1.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
2.  **Start the web server:** `npm start`
3.  **Open the application:** Navigate to `http://localhost:1234`.
4.  **Click "Start Full Analysis."** The workbench will run the deterministic simulation and then begin the dynamic batch analysis, which will continue until statistical confidence is reached or it is stopped by the user.
