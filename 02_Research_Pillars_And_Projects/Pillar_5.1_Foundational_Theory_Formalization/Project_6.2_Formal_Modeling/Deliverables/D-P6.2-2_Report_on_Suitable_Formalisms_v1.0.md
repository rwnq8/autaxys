### **1.0 Objective**

This report documents the selection and justification of the formalism used in the `P6.2` computational prototype. The objective of the prototype was to test the hypothesis that relational composition rules (specifically transitivity) emerge as a necessary condition for Ontological Closure. The selection of an appropriate formalism was critical to ensure that the model was both conceptually sound and computationally verifiable.

### **2.0 Formalism Selection: Directed Graphs**

After a review of potential modeling frameworks, **Directed Graphs** (also known as digraphs) were selected as the most suitable formalism for this initial phase of research.

A directed graph `G` is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vertices (nodes) and a set of ordered pairs of these vertices, called directed edges (or arcs).

This formalism provides a direct and intuitive mapping to the core concepts of the Autaxys model at this foundational level:

*   **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent fundamental "distinctions" or "entities" within a pattern. In the prototype, these were labeled simply as `1`, `2`, `3`.
*   **Directed Edges (Arcs):** Represent an "AsymmetricLink" or a directed, non-reciprocal relationship between two distinctions. An edge `(A, B)` is interpreted as the relation `A -> B`.

### **3.0 Justification of Suitability**

The choice of Directed Graphs was justified based on the following criteria:

1.  **Conceptual Clarity:** The mapping from the abstract concepts of "distinctions" and "relations" to the concrete mathematical objects of "nodes" and "edges" is unambiguous and direct. This clarity is essential for ensuring the model accurately reflects the theory it is intended to test.

2.  **Mathematical Rigor:** Graph theory is a well-established and rigorous field of mathematics. Concepts such as "path" (a sequence of edges), which are central to the definition of the `f(G)` transformation, are precisely defined, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

3.  **Computational Tractability:** Directed graphs are easily and efficiently represented in computational systems. As demonstrated in the final, dependency-free prototype, a graph can be implemented with basic Python dictionaries and sets, making the model transparent and universally executable. Operations like adding an edge or checking for the existence of a path are algorithmically straightforward.

4.  **Parsimony (Simplicity and Sufficiency):** The primary goal was to test the emergence of transitivity. A directed graph is the simplest possible structure that can represent the required pattern (`A -> B -> C`). More complex formalisms (e.g., weighted graphs, hypergraphs, temporal networks) would have introduced unnecessary complexity and variables not relevant to this foundational hypothesis. The chosen formalism is precisely as complex as it needs to be, and no more.

### **4.0 Acknowledged Limitations & Future Scope**

The selection of this simple formalism is specific to the scope of Project 6.2. The limitations of this approach are acknowledged and are intended to be addressed in later research phases as outlined in the Master Plan:

*   **Static Nature:** The model does not possess an intrinsic notion of time or continuous evolution.
*   **Uniform Relations:** All edges represent the same *type* of relationship.
*   **Lack of Higher-Order Dynamics:** The model cannot represent relations acting upon other relations.

These limitations were accepted by design. The purpose of this initial project was not to create a comprehensive model of reality, but to validate a single, fundamental principle in isolation. Future projects, such as `P6.3 (Autaxic Cosmogenesis)`, will necessitate the adoption of more advanced formalisms capable of handling these complexities.

### **5.0 Conclusion**

Directed Graphs proved to be an ideal formalism for the initial proof-of-concept. The framework provided the necessary conceptual clarity and computational power to successfully model the principle of Ontological Closure and demonstrate the emergence of transitivity as a condition for relational stability. This choice has been validated by the successful and verifiable execution of the experiment.
