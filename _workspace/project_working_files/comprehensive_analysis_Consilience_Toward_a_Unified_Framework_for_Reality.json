It proposes a quest for *consilience*—a unified framework—by employing a rigorous graph-based methodology to analyze the conceptual landscape of physics, mathematics, and philosophy. The goal is to map relationships between fundamental entities, identify sources of conflict, and generate principles for a more consilient meta-framework, anticipated to be grounded in information dynamics and relationality, leading to the *infomatics* framework.",

Through network analysis of this graph, the work exposes structural flaws, inconsistencies (like the GR/QM conflict), unresolved problems (like the measurement problem), and ad-hoc elements (like ΛCDM). The analysis concludes that these issues necessitate the development of a new, more unified and consilient meta-framework, anticipated to be grounded in information dynamics and relationality.",
