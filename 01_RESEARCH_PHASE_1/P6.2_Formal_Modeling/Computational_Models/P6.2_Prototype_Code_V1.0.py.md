# Date: 2025-06-08
#
# Objective:
# This script implements the computational prototype specified in
# D-P1-2.7.3.1_Computational_Prototype_Spec_V1.0.md. It aims to
# demonstrate that transitivity emerges as a necessary condition for
# ontological closure (modeled as self-referential stability) when
# composing simple, directed relational patterns.
