The approach combines ontology-based knowledge representation, Boolean decision trees, Bayesian updates, and information-theoretic measures. It involves constructing an ontology, formulating Boolean questions, using Bayesian inference to update knowledge, and employing information gain to guide exploration. Applied to a quantum harmonic oscillator via simulation, the method demonstrates effectiveness in converging on the ground state and quantifying information gain. The research aims to provide a practical framework for investigating information-theoretic aspects of complex systems, offering a novel perspective on Wheeler's hypothesis.",
