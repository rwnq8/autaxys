# Description: This script provides the initial scaffolding for the Autaxic Generative Engine (AGE).
#              It defines the core data structures for Distinctions, Relations, the RelationalGraph,
#              and the Engine itself. This version focuses on structure, with rule implementation
#              to follow in subsequent iterations.
