document_outline:
  title: "LinkedIn Article: Introducing Autaxys and Autology" # Placeholder, final title TBD in drafting
  target_deliverable_id: "D006.1_AUTX"
  version: "1.0"
  sections:
    - section_id: "1.0"
      title: "Beyond Bricks and Mortar: Is Our Universe Built from Self-Generating Patterns?" # Example Evocative Title
      objective: "Hook the reader by questioning conventional views of reality and hinting at a new perspective."
      key_points:
        - "Acknowledge the successes of modern physics but also its persistent foundational puzzles (e.g., nature of particles, origin of laws, dark sector mysteries – keep brief and accessible)."
        - "Pose the question: Are we looking at reality through the right lens? What if the 'fundamental stuff' isn't stuff at all?"

    - section_id: "2.0"
      title: "The Limits of 'Things' and the Ambiguity of 'Information'"
      objective: "Briefly explain why current common terms and object-based ontologies are insufficient for a truly foundational, generative principle."
      key_points:
        - "Shortcomings of viewing fundamental particles purely as 'things' (using an accessible example, perhaps hinting at the î₁ enigma without deep detail)."
        - "Why 'information', while crucial, often describes outcomes or processed data rather than the generative source of reality's patterns."

    - section_id: "3.0"
      title: "Introducing Autaxys: A Principle of Self-Generating Order"
      objective: "Introduce 'autaxys' as a new core concept in an accessible way."
      key_points:
        - "What is autaxys? (Simple, concise definition: a fundamental principle of reality as a self-ordering, self-arranging, and self-generating system that creates patterns)."
        - "Key idea: Reality actively organizes itself from within, without an external designer or pre-set rules imposed from outside."
        - "Analogy (optional, if a simple one can be found that doesn't oversimplify)."

    - section_id: "4.0"
      title: "Autology: A New Field to Study Our Pattern-Based Universe"
      objective: "Introduce 'autology' as the field of study."
      key_points:
        - "What is autology? (The study of autaxys – how it generates patterns, how these form our reality, and the implications)."
        - "Its interdisciplinary nature (touching physics, philosophy, complexity)."

    - section_id: "5.0"
      title: "Why This Matters: Towards a More Coherent 'Way of Seeing'"
      objective: "Highlight the potential impact and importance of this new perspective."
      key_points:
        - "Potential of autaxys/autology to reframe longstanding scientific puzzles (e.g., origin of complexity, nature of physical laws)."
        - "Connect to the 'wonder and discovery' aspect: offering a new lens to understand the universe's inherent creativity and order."
        - "How this can lead to a more unified and fundamental understanding."

    - section_id: "6.0"
      title: "Delving Deeper: The Foundational Document"
      objective: "Introduce the main D002 paper/document."
      key_points:
        - "Announce the availability of the foundational document: 'Autaxys and Autology: Definition, Rationale, and Implications'."
        - "Briefly state what readers will find in it (detailed definitions, etymology, characteristics, distinctions, initial philosophical implications)."

    - section_id: "7.0"
      title: "Join the Exploration: Read, Reflect, Discuss"
      objective: "Provide a clear call to action."
      key_points:
        - "Direct link to the full D002 document on qnfo.org (e.g., qnfo.org/research/autaxys-defined)."
        - "Invitation to engage with the ideas, provide feedback, and join the broader discussion."
        - "Reiterate the potential for a 'new way of seeing'."

    - section_id: "8.0"
      title: "Hashtags"
      objective: "List relevant hashtags for discoverability."
      key_points:
        - "[Placeholder: To be populated by output of D006.4 - Hashtag Strategy]"
        - "Initial thoughts: #Autaxys #Autology #FoundationalPhysics #PhilosophyOfScience #PatternBasedReality #NewScience #TheoreticalPhysics #Complexity #Ontology #Epistemology #ScienceCommunication"
