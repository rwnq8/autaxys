# Autaxys and Autology: Definition, Rationale, and Implications

## 1. Introduction: Imperative for New Foundational Terminology

The inquiry into the fundamental nature of reality necessitates not only novel conceptual frameworks but also a language precise enough to articulate them without ambiguity. This document introduces and defines two such foundational terms—**autaxys** and **autology**—central to the theoretical edifice being constructed within the research program "Autaxys: A Framework for Pattern-Based Reality." The motivation for these neologisms stems from a critical assessment of existing terminology and the inherent limitations encountered when attempting to repurpose words laden with established, often divergent, connotations.

The history of science and philosophy is replete with instances where new paradigms required new vocabularies. Terms like *information*, while central to the lineage of this work, carry a modern weight heavily influenced by communication theory (e.g., Shannon entropy) and data processing. While these aspects are relevant to understanding how patterns generated by a fundamental principle are perceived and modeled, they do not fully capture the intended ontological depth of a self-generating, pattern-forming principle that is posited as constitutive of reality itself. Similarly, classical terms like *logos*, though rich in philosophical heritage, come with extensive and varied interpretations that could obscure the specific, naturalistic framework intended here.

The project "Autaxys: A Framework for Pattern-Based Reality" aims to move beyond prevailing materialist and naive realist paradigms. It proposes that reality is fundamentally a dynamic, self-ordering system that generates all observable phenomena, including what we perceive as matter and physical laws, through the emergence and interaction of patterns. To speak clearly about this fundamental systemic principle and its dedicated field of study, unique and well-defined terms are indispensable.

This document, therefore, serves a critical role. It will first detail the etymological construction and conceptual underpinnings of autaxys (the principle) and autology (its study). It will then provide their formal definitions and elaborate upon their key characteristics. Subsequently, it will delineate crucial distinctions between these new terms and existing concepts to prevent misinterpretation and to highlight the unique theoretical space they are intended to occupy. Finally, it will briefly touch upon the philosophical implications of adopting an autaxys-centric worldview, setting the stage for more extensive explorations in other works, such as the monograph "A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autaxys." The clarity and precision sought here are vital for building a coherent and robust theoretical structure capable of offering new perspectives on the deepest questions concerning existence, perception, and knowledge.
