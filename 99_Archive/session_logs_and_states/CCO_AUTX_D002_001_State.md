Discuss the brain's role in processing signals, 'filling in' information, making inferences, and constructing a coherent perceptual world (using tangible examples like optical illusions, sensory adaptation).

Using detailed case studies of the 'Instrumental Seeing Spectrum' (e.g., electron microscopes, radio/optical telescopes, particle accelerators/detectors), demonstrate how these tools generate complex data patterns that require sophisticated processing, interpretation, and model-fitting to be understood as 'observations' of reality. Emphasize that this is not direct apprehension but a reconstruction of patterns from instrument-generated signals, further analyzing the 'Particle Paradox' in the context of how photons and neutrinos are 'seen' instrumentally."

Discuss theory-ladenness, confirmation bias, and how dominant paradigms can create 'blind spots' or 'mirages,' preventing the 'seeing' of phenomena that don't fit established conceptual boxes.

This necessitates a new methodological orientation. Introduce and advocate for the Structure First Methodology (SFM) as a conscious attempt to develop 'new eyes'—a way of 'seeing' that prioritizes discerning underlying generative principles and inherent patterns, potentially transcending the limitations of current observational and conceptual filters.
