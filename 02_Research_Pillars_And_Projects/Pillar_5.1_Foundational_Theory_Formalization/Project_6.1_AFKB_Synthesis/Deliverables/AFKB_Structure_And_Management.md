# README: QNFO Research Corpus - Autaxys Foundational Knowledge Base (AFKB) - Batch 1 (Pre-Autaxys/IO)

**Date Generated:** 2025-06-05

## 1. Introduction: Corpus Contents

This research corpus, compiled into the machine-readable JSON file `A0_AFKB_Artifacts_AllProcessed_V1.json`, represents a significant portion of the QNFO scientific research releases, publications, and informational reality research archives generated by Principal Investigator Rowan Brad Quni.

**Scope:** This specific compilation includes materials leading up to, and including, the "Infomatics" project (versions v0-v3.4, and the distinct v2.5 Operational Framework). It **does not** yet include later developments such as the "Information Ontology (IO) forward" project or the "Autaxys" project archives themselves, which are part of ongoing or subsequent research phases. This corpus primarily serves as foundational background, including critiques of existing paradigms and explorations of precursor frameworks that inform the current Autaxys research program.

The corpus consists of detailed analyses of approximately 184 individual documents (chapters, essays, appendices, reports) grouped into 15 thematic collections/works. These analyses were originally generated by the PI with AI assistance and have been further processed by Autologos into a structured format for the Autaxys Foundational Knowledge Base (AFKB).

## 2. The Autaxys Foundational Knowledge Base (AFKB) - General Concept

The AFKB is a structured, dynamic knowledge base designed to support the Autaxys Research & Development Program. Its purpose is to:
*   Systematically capture, organize, and synthesize key conceptual insights, definitions, arguments, critiques, methodologies, and findings from relevant internal and external works.
*   Facilitate the identification of "conceptual scaffolds" â€“ well-developed ideas or analytical tools that can support current Autaxys research projects.
*   Enable efficient querying and retrieval of information to support tasks such as literature review, conceptual mapping, and theory development.
*   Provide a transparent and auditable record of the knowledge informing the Autaxys framework.

This `A0_AFKB_Artifacts_AllProcessed_V1.json` file represents an initial, substantial population of the AFKB with pre-Autaxys foundational materials.

## 3. Purpose of this Compiled Corpus

The primary purpose of providing this corpus in a concise, machine-readable JSON format is to:
*   Facilitate the efficient progression of the Autaxys research program, particularly Project AUTX-A.1 (Formal Mathematical and Computational Modeling of the Autaxic Generative Engine).
*   Leverage the significant body of internally generated knowledge (represented by the ~184 analyzed files) in a reproducible and systematic way.
*   Maximize information gain and synthesis by allowing computational tools (like Autologos) and researchers to query and analyze relationships across the entire corpus, rather than parsing numerous individual files manually.
*   Serve as a reference for external researchers interested in the intellectual lineage and foundational critiques that inform the Autaxys project.

## 4. Data Dictionary for `A0_AFKB_Artifacts_AllProcessed_V1.json`

The `A0_AFKB_Artifacts_AllProcessed_V1.json` file contains a single JSON array. Each element in the array is an "AFKB Artifact Object" representing one analyzed document/chapter. The structure of each object is as follows:

*   **`afkb_artifact_id`** (String): A unique identifier assigned by Autologos to this artifact within the AFKB (e.g., "ANWOS_Ch1", "FID_0019_I1_Hypothesis").
*   **`afkb_source_work_title`** (String): The title of the larger work or collection from which the specific document/chapter originates (e.g., "A New Way of Seeing: Autaxys as a Framework for Pattern-Based Reality, from Rocks to Neutrinos", "Infomatics archive").
*   **`fileName`** (String): The original filename of the analyzed document as provided in the input JSON analysis (e.g., "1 Particle Paradox.md").
*   **`entities`** (Array of Strings): A list of key entities (people, concepts, theories, places) identified in the document.
*   **`keyPhrases`** (Array of Strings): A list of significant key phrases extracted from the document.
*   **`themes`** (Array of Strings): A list of overarching themes addressed by the document.
*   **`summary`** (String): A concise summary of the document's content and arguments.
*   **`topTerms`** (Array of Objects): A list of the most frequent terms and their counts. Each object has:
    *   `term` (String): The term.
    *   `frequency` (Integer): Its frequency.
*   **`uniqueContributions`** (Array of Strings): A list describing the unique arguments or perspectives offered by the document.
*   **`keyExcerpts`** (Array of Strings): A list of direct, notable quotations from the source document (as provided in the input JSON analysis).
*   **`bibliographicInfo`** (Object): Bibliographic details for the specific document/chapter. Fields may vary but typically include:
    *   `title` (String): Title of the specific document/chapter.
    *   `partNumber` (String/Integer, Optional): Chapter or section number.
    *   `partPrefix` (String, Optional): E.g., "Chapter", "Section", "Appendix".
    *   `documentType` (String): E.g., "chapter", "manuscript", "report".
    *   `authors` (Array of Strings): Author(s), typically "Rowan Brad Quni".
    *   `year` (String/Integer): Year of publication/creation.
    *   `publisher` (String, Optional): E.g., "QNFO".
    *   `doi` (String, Optional): Digital Object Identifier.
    *   `url` (String, Optional): URL for access.
    *   `sourceName` (String, Optional): Title of the containing work if different from `afkb_source_work_title`.
    *   `volume` (String/Integer, Optional).
    *   `uncertainFields` (Array of Strings, Optional): Lists any bibliographic fields where data was uncertain in the source analysis.
*   **`afkb_conceptual_links`** (Array of Objects): A list of identified conceptual relationships to other AFKB artifacts. Each object has:
    *   `linked_artifact_id` (String): The `afkb_artifact_id` of the target artifact.
    *   `relationship_type` (String): The nature of the link (e.g., "builds_upon_critique_of", "provides_evidence_for", "contrasts_with_ontology_of").
    *   `description` (String, Optional): A brief explanation of the link.
*   **`afkb_pi_assessment_relevance`** (String): Placeholder for PI's assessment of the artifact's relevance to Autaxys (e.g., "core_pending_review", "methodology_critique_pending_review"). Default: "pending_review".
*   **`afkb_pi_assessment_status`** (String): Placeholder for PI's assessment of the artifact's integration status (e.g., "to_integrate_pending_review"). Default: "to_integrate_pending_review".
*   **`afkb_autaxys_keywords`** (Array of Strings): Keywords linking this artifact to core Autaxys concepts or relevant themes for formalization (e.g., "autaxys_ontology_contrast", "autaxys_formalism_requirements").

This structured data is intended to facilitate programmatic access, querying, and synthesis for the Autaxys research program.
