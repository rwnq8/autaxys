### **1.0 Introduction**

1.1.1 The Autaxys framework posits that the universe evolves according to a fundamental principle: the maximization of the total **Autaxic Action ($A_A$)**, where $A_A = \sum L_A(G_t)$. The **Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A(G_t)$)** quantifies the "Relational Aesthetics" or "existential fitness" of a given graph state $G_t$.
1.1.2 A critical aspect of the Autaxys v2.0 formalization is the proposal of a *computable mechanism* by which this global principle is implemented. This document elaborates on the choice and justification of the **greedy local optimization mechanism** and discusses the nature of the Autaxic Lagrangian.

### **2.0 The Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A(G)$): A Measure of Existential Fitness**

2.1.1 **Conceptual Basis:** $L_A(G)$ must be a scalar function that evaluates the "quality" of a global graph state $G$. This quality is tied to the **Economy of Existence**, favoring states that efficiently embody stability and coherent structure.
2.1.2 **Relation to $S/C$ for Patterns:** While the Stability-to-Complexity ratio ($S/C$) is the core metric for individual stable patterns ($P_{ID}$s), $L_A(G)$ is a global functional. It is hypothesized that $L_A(G_t)$ is:
    2.1.2.1 A function of the aggregated $S/C$ ratios of all significant, identifiable patterns within $G_t$.
    2.1.2.2 Inclusive of terms that measure the overall structural coherence and efficiency of $G_t$ itself (e.g., global graph complexity, measures of proto-property harmony).
    2.1.2.3 Potentially sensitive to the *potential* for future high-$L_A$ pattern formation given the current state and rule set.
2.1.3 **Computability:** A key constraint is that $L_A(G_t)$ must be *computable* for any given graph state $G_t$ within the framework. This necessitates approximations and proxies, especially for concepts like global Kolmogorov Complexity or comprehensive pattern stability.
2.1.4 **MVU-1 Example:** For the Minimal Viable Universe (MVU-1), $L_A(G) = \frac{N_{bonded\_pairs}}{|D| + |R| + \epsilon}$ serves as a simple, computable proxy. It directly rewards a specific desired structure relative to overall size, aligning with the S/C spirit. Future research will focus on developing more sophisticated and generalizable forms of $L_A(G)$.

### **3.0 The Autaxic Action Principle: A Global Objective**

3.1.1 The principle $\text{Maximize } A_A = \sum L_A(G_t)$ states that the realized history of the universe is one that maximizes the cumulative "existential fitness" over its entire discrete timeline.
3.1.2 This is a global optimization problem over the space of all possible evolutionary paths. Solving such a problem directly is computationally intractable, requiring knowledge of all future states and their $L_A$ values.

### **4.0 The Local Optimization Mechanism: A Computable Implementation**

4.1.1 **The Challenge of Global Optimization:** The universe, at step $t$, cannot "know" the $L_A$ values of all possible future states $G_{t+n}$ for large $n$.
4.1.2 **The Greedy Heuristic:** The Autaxys v2.0 framework proposes that the global Action Principle is implemented via a **greedy, local optimization heuristic**. At each step $t$, the system evolves from $G_t$ to $G_{t+1}$ by selecting the single transformation (rule application) that maximizes $L_A(G_{t+1})$.
    > $$ G_{t+1} = \underset{G' \in \{\text{candidate states from } G_t\}}{\text{argmax}} (L_A(G')) $$
4.1.3 **Justification and Hypotheses:**
    4.1.3.1 **Computational Tractability:** This local mechanism is computationally feasible. It only requires evaluating the $L_A$ of states reachable in *one step*.
    4.1.3.2 **Hill-Climbing Analogy:** This mechanism is analogous to a hill-climbing algorithm on a landscape where height represents $L_A$. The system always takes the steepest available uphill step.
    4.1.3.3 **Hypothesis of Sufficiency:** The core hypothesis is that this iterative, greedy local maximization of $L_A$ is *sufficient* to drive the system towards paths that, over long timescales, approximate or achieve a high value for the total accumulated action $A_A$. This implies that the "landscape" defined by $L_A$ and the graph rewrite rules is structured such that local optima frequently align with globally favorable trajectories, or that the meta-dynamics (evolution of rules) shapes the landscape to have this property.
    4.1.3.4 **Not Guaranteed Global Maximum:** It is acknowledged that greedy algorithms do not universally guarantee finding the true global maximum of a sum. The system might become trapped in local $A_A$ maxima. However, it is hypothesized that:
        4.1.3.4.1 The inherent nature of the Autaxys primitives, rules, and the form of $L_A$ (especially its grounding in $S/C$) creates a landscape where such "traps" still represent highly ordered and stable states.
        4.1.3.4.2 The potential for *algorithmic self-modification* (evolution of the rule set $\{r_i\}$ or even $L_A$ itself, as per the broader conceptual framework) provides a mechanism for the system to escape local optima over much longer cosmic timescales.

### **5.0 Implications and Future Research**

5.1.1 The choice of a local optimization mechanism makes the Autaxys framework computationally approachable and allows for simulation and testing (e.g., MVU-1).
5.1.2 A significant area of future theoretical and computational research will be to:
    5.1.2.1 Investigate the relationship between local $L_A$ maximization and global $A_A$ maximization for different classes of graph rewrite systems and $L_A$ definitions.
    5.1.2.2 Explore conditions under which the greedy heuristic is provably optimal or provides good approximations.
    5.1.2.3 Develop more sophisticated, yet still computable, look-ahead mechanisms or probabilistic selection rules that might better approximate global $A_A$ maximization if the simple greedy approach proves insufficient to generate observed complexity.

This local optimization mechanism, driven by a computable Autaxic Lagrangian, is the core computational conjecture of the Autaxys v2.0 framework for how the universe generates stable, coherent structures.
