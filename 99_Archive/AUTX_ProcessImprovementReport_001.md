  introduction: "This report details critical operational failures, insights gained, and proposed template improvements identified during the initial phases of Project AUTX. The objective is to provide a clear basis for refining the ProjectOrchestratorASO template and associated AI operational protocols to prevent recurrence of these issues and enhance overall project efficiency and reliability."

  identified_issues:
    - issue_id: "ISS_AUTX_001"
      description: "Persistent AI difficulty in consistently applying nuanced capitalization and formatting rules for headings, defined common nouns (autaxys, autology, information), and bulleted lists in Knowledge Artifacts (specifically KA_AUTX_Primer), despite multiple iterations and specific user guidance."
      severity: "High"
      impact: "Reduced quality of deliverables, user frustration, wasted project time on stylistic minutiae."
      status: "Open - Requires systemic fix in AI style application logic and/or Style Guide KA template."

    - issue_id: "ISS_AUTX_002"
      description: "AI failed to use correct sequential numbering for project state filename suggestions and initially proposed redundant '_Current' state files. AI also initially included TIDs/Issues in AUTX_State_001 that were only identified *because* of errors in outputting AUTX_State_001."
      severity: "Critical"
      impact: "Incorrect file management, potential data confusion, inconsistent state logging, wasted project time."

    - issue_id: "ISS_AUTX_003"
      description: "AI failed to correctly apply metadata protocols for segmented outputs of a single large conceptual document (project_state), specifically by incorrectly repeating `filename_base` and using unique `document_id`s for each segment instead of a shared `document_id` and unique `segment_id`."
      severity: "High" # Downgraded from Critical as content was not lost, but metadata was confusing
      impact: "Confusing and incorrect metadata for segmented outputs, potential difficulty in reassembling large documents, user frustration."

      description: "Initial concern and past instances (though not in the immediate last `project_state` output attempt) of AI truncating large YAML outputs without warning or correct application of Large Output Handling Protocol."
      severity: "Critical"
      impact: "Data loss, incomplete project state, unusable outputs."

    - insight_id: "INS_AUTX_001"
      description: "AI's internal style engine or application of capitalization rules for defined common nouns vs. proper nouns, especially in headings and lists, is insufficiently robust and requires more explicit, potentially simplified, rule sets in the Style Guide KA and Orchestrator template."

    - insight_id: "INS_AUTX_002_MiscommunicationEscalation"
      description: "A formal 'Miscommunication Escalation & Authoritative Reference Protocol' is needed when AI repeatedly fails to implement user corrections on a specific point after 1-2 attempts. This involves AI acknowledging the loop, and proactively suggesting direct user editing of the relevant KA or collaborative re-definition of the rule."

      description: "AI's protocol for suggesting project state filenames needs to be strictly sequential (e.g., _001, _002) with no separate '_Current' file. The content of a state file (e.g., AUTX_State_001) must accurately reflect the project state *at the point of that save*, not including metadata (issues, TIDs) generated *about the process of saving that very file*."

      description: "The protocol for prepending metadata to output blocks needs to be precise for segmented outputs of a single large conceptual document. Segment 1 gets `id` (as filename_base) and `document_id`. Subsequent segments share the main `document_id` and have a `segment_id`, but no repeated `id` (filename_base)."

      proposed_change_details: "Define and integrate the 'Miscommunication Escalation & Authoritative Reference Protocol': After 1-2 failed attempts by AI to implement a specific user correction, AI acknowledges the loop, identifies the relevant KA (e.g., Style Guide), and prompts the user to directly edit that KA section or collaboratively redefine the rule. AI then uses this user-corrected KA/rule as the absolute standard."
      rationale: "Prevents user frustration, saves time, improves AI learning from direct authoritative corrections."

      target_section_or_field: "Logic for outputting `project_state` and general file outputs; Metadata prepending logic."
      issue_description: "Incorrect project state filename suggestions (non-sequential, redundant '_Current'), inclusion of contemporaneous metadata in initial state files, and potential for output truncation."
      proposed_change_type: "UpdateProceduralLogic"
      proposed_change_details: |
        1.  **State Filenaming:** When prompting user to save `project_state`, AI MUST use a sequential numbering scheme (e.g., `[ProjectCode]_State_[SequenceNumber]`, starting with `001`). The file with the highest sequence number is the current state. Deprecate separate `_State_Current` file.
        2.  **State Content Integrity:** The content of a saved state file (e.g., `AUTX_State_001`) MUST accurately reflect the project state *at the point of that save decision*, excluding metadata (issues, TIDs) generated *about the process of saving that specific file instance*. Such contemporaneous metadata belongs to the *next* state.
        3.  **Output Completeness:** Before presenting any YAML for user saving (especially `project_state`), AI MUST perform internal verification for NO truncation. If full content exceeds platform limits for a single block, the "Large Output Handling Protocol" (segmented output with user acknowledgements for each segment) MUST be applied to the *entire conceptual document*.
        4.  **Simplified Output Metadata:** For distinct documents (KAs, reports, plans, or the first segment of a large state file), prepend metadata with: `id` (as filename_base), `project_code`, `version` (of the content), `purpose`.
        5.  **Segmented Output Metadata (Refined TID_AUTX_003 logic integrated here):** For subsequent segments of a single large conceptual document (like `project_state`): Metadata block includes the main `document_id` (from Segment 1's `id` or a dedicated `document_id` field if preferred for clarity), a `segment_id` (e.g., "2_of_X_ContentDescription"), and `purpose`. It does NOT repeat `id` (as filename_base) or `project_code` if already in Segment 1's metadata for that document.
      rationale: "Ensures correct and simplified file management, complete data integrity, accurate state logging, and clear context for all saved outputs."

      target_section_or_field: "Embedded `AUTX_StyleGuide` content definition (within Section I of Orchestrator if KAs are embedded, or the Style Guide KA template if separate)"
      issue_description: "Persistent AI difficulty in applying capitalization rules correctly, especially for defined common nouns vs. proper nouns in various contexts (prose, headings, lists)."
      proposed_change_type: "ModifyKAContentDefinition"
      proposed_change_details: "The `capitalization` section of the Style Guide definition needs to be extremely explicit and simplified: 1. Define project-specific neologisms ('autaxys', 'autology', 'autaxic table') as common nouns in the Glossary. 2. The Style Guide's capitalization rule should then state: 'Adhere to standard English capitalization rules. Common nouns (including project-defined terms like 'autaxys') are lowercase unless they begin a sentence. Formal proper titles (Project Name, Deliverable Titles) use Title Case, where significant common nouns within the title are capitalized. Section headings follow sentence case (first word capitalized, subsequent common nouns lowercase unless proper nouns). Bulleted list items: first word capitalized. Bolded lead-in phrases for bullets use Title Case, and the first word of subsequent descriptive text is capitalized.' This removes ambiguity about special treatment."
      rationale: "To provide the AI with an unambiguous, simplified set of capitalization rules based on standard English conventions once terms are classified as common/proper in the Glossary, reducing errors and user frustration."

  conclusion: "The identified issues highlight critical areas where the AI's operational logic and adherence to protocols (especially regarding output generation, metadata consistency, and stylistic nuance) need significant improvement. Implementing the proposed TIDs is essential for the viability of complex projects managed by this Orchestrator framework. The immediate priority for Project AUTX, once this report is acknowledged, is for the user to take these TIDs and use them to guide the manual correction/update of the master `ProjectOrchestratorASO` template. Only then can the AUTX project reliably proceed to the Planning Phase."
