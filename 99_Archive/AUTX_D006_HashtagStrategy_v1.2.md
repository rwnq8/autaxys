# Hashtag Strategy for Autaxys/Autology Content Promotion (v1.2)

**Objective:** To maximize visibility and engagement for content related to autaxys, autology, and the foundational document D002 ("Autaxys and Autology: Definition, Rationale, and Implications") on LinkedIn Posts and Mastodon Science Channels, by leveraging existing, recognized, and well-followed hashtags. The core concept being promoted is a *pattern-based reality* emerging from autaxys.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Relevance:** Hashtags must be directly related to the core concepts or the broader fields of discussion.
*   **Discoverability (Prioritized):** Utilize established, broad hashtags known to be followed by relevant communities. For Mastodon, this includes tags that may trigger reposts by automated channels. For LinkedIn, this includes professionally relevant conceptual tags.
*   **Meaningfulness & Conciseness:** Avoid overly generic, obscure, or unrecognized long/compound hashtags. Each tag should add clear contextual value.
*   **Platform Appropriateness:** Adapt hashtag usage to platform conventions.
*   **Strategic Mix:** Combine primary branded/conceptual tags with broader discoverability tags.

**Primary Branded Hashtag:**
*   **#QNFO** (To be used consistently across platforms for initiative recognition)

**Core Concept Hashtags (for branding & specific search, use judiciously alongside broader tags):**
*   **#autaxys**
*   **#autology**
    *Usage Note:* These can be effectively used *in-body* on platforms like Mastodon to save characters and integrate naturally.

**High-Visibility / Discoverability Hashtags:**

*   **For Mastodon (Science/Academic Focus):**
    *   **Primary Repost Triggers:** #science, #physics, #research, #academia
    *   **Strongly Relevant Academic:** #philosophy, #metaphysics, #PhilosophyOfScience, #Ontology, #TheoreticalPhysics, #FoundationalPhysics, #ComplexityScience, #SystemsTheory
*   **For LinkedIn (Broader Professional / Conceptual Focus):**
    *   **Conceptual/Intellectual:** #BigIdeas, #ParadigmShift, #SystemsThinking, #Innovation, #FutureOfScience
    *   **Relevant Academic/Philosophical (use selectively):** #PhilosophyOfScience, #Ontology, #TheoreticalPhysics, #ComplexityScience
    *   **General Professional:** #ThoughtLeadership (if appropriate for the post's framing)

**Methodology & Approach Hashtags (Use sparingly, if highly relevant to post content):**
*   **#NewScience** (If emphasizing paradigm shift aspect)
*   **#InterdisciplinaryResearch**

**Specific Anomaly/Topic Hashtags (Use only when post content is highly specific):**
*   **#infoton** or **#i1Pattern**
*   **#StandardModel** (When critiquing or comparing)

**Recommended Usage Strategy:**

*   **For Mastodon Posts (e.g., <= 500 characters):**
    1.  Integrate **#QNFO**. Consider integrating **#autaxys** and/or **#autology** into the post body if natural.
    2.  Prioritize 3-5 high-visibility discoverability tags from the Mastodon list (especially #science, #physics, #research, #academia).
    3.  If space allows, 1-2 additional highly relevant academic tags.
*   **For LinkedIn Posts (e.g., up to 3000 characters):**
    1.  Always include **#QNFO**. Consider including **#autaxys** and **#autology** if the post is sufficiently focused on introducing them.
    2.  Select 3-5 hashtags, prioritizing those from the "LinkedIn (Broader Professional / Conceptual Focus)" list. Mix with 1-2 relevant academic tags if the post has that depth.
    3.  Hashtags are typically placed at the end for LinkedIn, but in-body can be used if it enhances readability for a key term.
*   **Avoid Over-Hashtagging:** Focus on quality and relevance.
*   **Avoid Unrecognized Compound Hashtags:** Do not use long, multi-word hashtags without spaces (e.g., `#PatternBasedReality` is a core *concept*, not a recommended *hashtag* for general discovery).
*   **Monitor and Adapt:** Observe engagement to refine strategy over time.

This revised strategy aims to leverage existing, well-followed hashtags for broader reach while still branding the core concepts.
