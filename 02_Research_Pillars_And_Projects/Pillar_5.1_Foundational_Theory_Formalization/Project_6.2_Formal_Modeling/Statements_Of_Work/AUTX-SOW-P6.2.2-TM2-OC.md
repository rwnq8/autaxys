**Project Title:** "Toy Model" (AGE v0.1) - Formalize Ontological Closure (OC) via Tension Minimization

**1. Objective:**  
To formally define and specify a "Relational Tension" function for subgraphs within the AGE v0.1 framework, and to define Ontological Closure (OC) in terms of a subgraph representing a local minimum of this tension function. This will complement the "Fixed Point" OC definition already explored.

**2. Scope of Work / Key Activities:**  
* **2.1 Define "Relational Tension" Function:**  
* Based on the proto-properties defined for AGE v0.1 (e.g., ProtoPolarity, ProtoValence for Distinctions (D-nodes) as per AUTX_A1_FormalNotation_AGEv0.1_V1.md and AUTX-A0-CCD-TM-001), formally define a function Tension(S) that takes a subgraph S and returns a scalar value representing its relational tension.  
* Consider the suggestions from AUTX-A0-CCD-TM-001 (e.g., tension from unsatisfied valences and unbalanced polarities on nodes with unsatisfied valences).  
* Specify the mathematical form of this function using the established notation.  
* **2.2 Define OC via Tension Minimization:**  
* Formally define what it means for a subgraph S to be at a "local minimum" of the Tension(S) function. This should consider the application of the core "Cosmic Algorithm" rules (GenesisRule, FormationRule, AnnihilationRule as defined in AUTX_A1_AGEv0.1_CoreRules_V1.md).  
* A possible definition: A subgraph S achieves OC via tension minimization if no single application of an available core rule to S (or its components) results in a new state S' such that Tension(S') < Tension(S).  
* **2.3 Documentation:** Document the formal definition of the Tension(S) function and the OC criterion based on its minimization in the AFKB (e.g., as AUTX_A1_AGEv0.1_OC_TensionMin_V1.md).

**3. Inputs:**  
* _25161103619.md (Toy Model Proposal - Phase 1, Step 3 OC definitions).  
* AUTX-A0-CCD-TM-001 (Conceptual Clarification Document, section on OC and Tension).  
* AUTX_A1_FormalNotation_AGEv0.1_V1.md (Defined primitives and their attributes).  
* AUTX_A1_AGEv0.1_Primitives_V1.md (Formal specification of primitives).  
* AUTX_A1_AGEv0.1_CoreRules_V1.md (Formal definition of core algorithm rules).  
* D-P6.7-1_Unified_Framework_v1.9.md (Conceptual basis for proto-properties and their role in stability).

**4. Deliverables:**  
* **D1:** A document (AFKB Artifact ID: AUTX_A1_AGEv0.1_OC_TensionMin_V1.md) containing:  
* The formal mathematical definition of the RelationalTension(S) function for AGE v0.1.  
* The formal definition of Ontological Closure based on a subgraph being a local minimum of this tension function with respect to the defined core algorithm rules.

**5. Assumptions:**  
* The proto-properties and core rules defined for AGE v0.1 are sufficient to formulate a meaningful tension function.  
* The concept of a "local minimum" with respect to the existing rules is a tractable definition for OC.

**6. Risks:**  
* Defining a simple yet meaningful RelationalTension function for the toy model might be more complex than anticipated.  
* The "local minimum" condition might be difficult to operationalize computationally or may lead to trivial stable states without careful definition.

**7. Success Criteria:**  
* The RelationalTension(S) function is mathematically well-defined using the established notation and proto-properties of AGE v0.1.  
* The OC criterion based on tension minimization is formally stated and references the core algorithm rules.  
* The definition is sufficiently clear to guide its potential implementation in the AGE v0.1 simulation.
