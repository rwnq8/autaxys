The Big Bang is framed as a resolution threshold, not an origin; photons as κ transitions approximated by Î; and black holes as ε bottlenecks.

        "The need for potentially less anthropocentric mathematical tools for deeper scientific understanding"
      ],
      "summary": "This text, \"Ten-Fingered Trap\", argues that the dominance of the base-10 numerical system stems from the biological accident of having ten fingers, not mathematical superiority. It contrasts this anthropocentric origin with alternative bases and natural cycles, highlighting base-10's limitations in representing common fractions and its friction with binary computing. The author distinguishes fundamental mathematical constants (like Pi) from unit-dependent physical constants (*c*, *h*), arguing the latter are tied to our decimal-based measurement conventions (like the metric system). Modern physics, particularly the holographic principle, is presented as challenging our base-10 and unit-dependent descriptions of reality, suggesting a need for evolving our mathematical tools to better align with potentially deeper, information-based structures of the universe. References include *Exposition du système du monde* by Laplace and research on language and base-10 learning.",
