## 2. Etymology and Conceptual Lineage: Crafting 'Autaxys' and 'Autology'

The selection of new terminology for foundational concepts is a deliberate act, aiming for precision, conceptual resonance, and a degree of uniqueness that allows the ideas to be discussed without immediate conflation with pre-existing, potentially ill-fitting notions. The terms 'autaxys' and 'autology' have been crafted with these considerations in mind, drawing from classical roots to encapsulate the core tenets of a self-generating, pattern-based reality.

### 2.1 Etymology of autaxys

The term **autaxys** is a neologism constructed from two primary Greek roots:

*   **"Auto-" (αὐτός - autos):** This prefix conveys the meanings of "self," "same," "spontaneous," or "by oneself." Its inclusion is paramount, emphasizing the principle's inherent capacity for self-causation, self-generation, self-organization, and self-arrangement. It underscores the intrinsic nature of the dynamics, operating without reliance on external agents, pre-ordained blueprints, or transcendent forces to impose order or initiate activity. The "auto-" component speaks to an immanent, autonomous foundation for reality.

*   **"Taxis" (τάξις - taxis):** This root signifies "arrangement," "order" (particularly good or due order), "system," "disposition," "post," or "rank." It implies a structured, rule-governed, and systemic quality. The concept of taxis is fundamental to understanding classification and organization, as seen in its derivative "taxonomy." In the context of autaxys, taxis points to the inherent orderliness and systematic nature of the principle and the patterns it generates.

Combined, **autaxys** is intended to signify a fundamental principle characterized by *self-ordering, self-arrangement, and the capacity of a system to generate its own structure and dynamics intrinsically.* It points to a reality that is not passively ordered by external laws, but actively and continuously orders itself.

### 2.2 Etymology of autology

The term **autology**, designated as the field of study dedicated to understanding autaxys, is also derived from Greek:

*   **"Auto-":** As above, referring to "self," but in this context, it points to autaxys as the primary subject of inquiry.
*   **"-logy" (-λογία - logia):** A common suffix in academic disciplines, derived from *logos* (λόγος), meaning "word," "reason," "account," "study of," or "science of."

Thus, **autology** straightforwardly means "the study of autaxys." It is the systematic investigation into the nature of this self-ordering principle, its manifestations as patterns, the processes by which it generates discernible phenomena, and the broader implications of this framework.

### 2.3 Rationale for Neologisms

The introduction of 'autaxys' and 'autology' was deemed necessary after careful consideration of existing terminology. The primary motivation was to achieve conceptual clarity and avoid the extensive, often conflicting, baggage associated with terms like *information* (heavily tied to Shannon's communication theory or everyday data contexts, rather than an ontological generative principle) or the classical *logos* (which carries diverse philosophical and theological interpretations over millennia). While the research lineage draws inspiration from information-theoretic perspectives and the philosophical depth of *logos*, new terms were required to precisely delineate the unique ontological status and characteristics attributed to the foundational principle of this framework. The aim is to provide a fresh conceptual space for developing a theory of a pattern-based reality grounded in intrinsic, self-generating order.
