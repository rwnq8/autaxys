# Autaxys and Autology: Definition, Rationale, and Implications

**Version:** 1.0
**Project:** AUTX - Autaxys: A Framework for Pattern-Based Reality

---

## 1. Preamble: The Imperative for New Foundational Terminology

The inquiry into the fundamental nature of reality necessitates not only novel conceptual frameworks but also a language precise enough to articulate them without ambiguity. This document introduces and defines two such foundational terms—**autaxys** and **autology**—central to the theoretical edifice being constructed within the research program “Autaxys: A Framework for Pattern-Based Reality.” The motivation for these neologisms stems from a critical assessment of existing terminology and the inherent limitations encountered when attempting to repurpose words laden with established, often divergent, connotations.

The history of science and philosophy is replete with instances where new paradigms required new vocabularies. Terms like *information*, while central to the lineage of this work, carry a modern weight heavily influenced by communication theory (e.g., Shannon information) and data processing. While these aspects are relevant to understanding how patterns generated by a fundamental principle are perceived and modeled, they do not fully capture the intended ontological depth of a self-generating, pattern-forming principle that is posited as constitutive of reality itself. Similarly, classical terms like *logos*, though rich in philosophical heritage, come with extensive and varied interpretations that could obscure the specific, naturalistic framework intended here.

The project “Autaxys: A Framework for Pattern-Based Reality” aims to move beyond prevailing materialist and naive realist paradigms. It proposes that reality is fundamentally a dynamic, self-ordering system that generates all observable phenomena, including what we perceive as matter and physical laws, through the emergence and interaction of patterns. To speak clearly about this fundamental systemic principle and its dedicated field of study, unique and well-defined terms are indispensable.

This document, therefore, serves a critical role. It will first detail the etymological construction and conceptual underpinnings of autaxys (the principle) and autology (its study). It will then provide their formal definitions and elaborate upon their key characteristics. Subsequently, it will delineate crucial distinctions between these new terms and existing concepts to prevent misinterpretation and to highlight the unique theoretical space they are intended to occupy. Finally, it will briefly touch upon the philosophical implications of adopting an autaxys-centric worldview, setting the stage for more extensive explorations in other works, such as the monograph “A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autaxys.” The clarity and precision sought here are vital for building a coherent and robust theoretical structure capable of offering new perspectives on the deepest questions concerning existence, perception, and knowledge.

## 2. Etymology and Conceptual Lineage: Crafting ‘Autaxys’ and ‘Autology’

The selection of new terminology for foundational concepts is a deliberate act, aiming for precision, conceptual resonance, and a degree of uniqueness that allows the ideas to be discussed without immediate conflation with pre-existing, potentially ill-fitting notions. The terms ‘autaxys’ and ‘autology’ have been crafted with these considerations in mind, drawing from classical roots to encapsulate the core tenets of a self-generating, pattern-based reality.

### 2.1 Etymology of Autaxys

The term **autaxys** is a neologism constructed from two primary Greek roots:

-   **“Auto-” (αὐτός - autos):** This prefix conveys the meanings of “self,” “same,” “spontaneous,” or “by oneself.” Its inclusion is paramount, emphasizing the principle’s inherent capacity for self-causation, self-generation, self-organization, and self-arrangement. It underscores the intrinsic nature of the dynamics, operating without reliance on external agents, pre-ordained blueprints, or transcendent forces to impose order or initiate activity. The “auto-” component speaks to an immanent, autonomous foundation for reality.

-   **“Taxis” (τάξις - taxis):** This root signifies “arrangement,” “order” (particularly good or due order), “system,” “disposition,” “post,” or “rank.” It implies a structured, rule-governed, and systemic quality. The concept of taxis is fundamental to understanding classification and organization, as seen in its derivative “taxonomy.” In the context of autaxys, taxis points to the inherent orderliness and systematic nature of the principle and the patterns it generates.

Combined, autaxys is intended to signify a fundamental principle characterized by *self-ordering, self-arrangement, and the capacity of a system to generate its own structure and dynamics intrinsically.* It points to a reality that is not passively ordered by external laws, but actively and continuously orders itself.

### 2.2 Etymology of Autology

The term **autology**, designated as the field of study dedicated to understanding autaxys, is also derived from Greek:

-   **“Auto-”:** As above, referring to “self,” but in this context, it points to autaxys as the primary subject of inquiry.
-   **“-logy” (-λογία - logia):** A common suffix in academic disciplines, derived from *logos* (λόγος), meaning “word,” “reason,” “account,” “study of,” or “science of.”

Thus, autology straightforwardly means “the study of autaxys.” It is the systematic investigation into the nature of this self-ordering principle, its manifestations as patterns, the processes by which it generates discernible phenomena, and the broader implications of this framework.

### 2.3 Rationale for Neologisms

The introduction of ‘autaxys’ and ‘autology’ was deemed necessary after careful consideration of existing terminology. The primary motivation was to achieve conceptual clarity and avoid the extensive, often conflicting, baggage associated with terms like *information* (heavily tied to Shannon information or everyday data contexts, rather than an ontological generative principle) or the classical *logos* (which carries diverse philosophical and theological interpretations over millennia). While the research lineage draws inspiration from information-theoretic perspectives and the philosophical depth of *logos*, new terms were required to precisely delineate the unique ontological status and characteristics attributed to the foundational principle of this framework. The aim is to provide a fresh conceptual space for developing a theory of a pattern-based reality grounded in intrinsic, self-generating order.

## 3. Core Definition: Autaxys–Fundamental Ontological Principle

Within the field of autology, **autaxys** is formally defined as the fundamental principle of reality conceived as a self-ordering, self-arranging, and self-generating system. It is the inherent dynamic process by which patterns emerge, persist, and interact, giving rise to all discernible structures and phenomena. These phenomena include what is perceived by observing systems as information, as well as the regularities interpreted as physical laws, and the complex, stable patterns identified as matter, energy, space, and time. A core tenet is that autaxys operates without recourse to an external organizing agent or pre-imposed set of rules; the principles of its ordering and generation are intrinsic to its nature.

This definition positions autaxys not as a substance or a static entity, but as the foundational *activity* or *dynamic potentiality* from which all structured existence arises. It is both the ultimate source of order and the ongoing process of that order manifesting and evolving. The emphasis on “system” highlights its interconnected and rule-governed nature, while “self-generating” points to its capacity to bring forth novelty and complexity from its own internal dynamics. The patterns generated by autaxys are not merely incidental byproducts but are its primary mode of expression and the basis for all knowable reality.

## 4. Key Characteristics of Autaxys

The concept of autaxys, as the subject of autology, is defined not only by its core definition but also by several key characteristics that delineate its operational nature and ontological status. These characteristics collectively paint a picture of a dynamic, self-sufficient, and foundational principle.

First, autaxys possesses **ontological primacy**. It is posited as the ultimate ground of being. From this perspective, what are commonly perceived as fundamental entities such as matter and energy, or fundamental structures like space, time, and even physical laws, are considered emergent manifestations. They are descriptions of autaxys’s behavior and the persistent, interactive patterns it generates, rather than being primary constituents of reality themselves.

Second, autaxys is inherently **dynamic and processual**. It is not a static substance or a fixed, pre-ordained blueprint that reality merely instantiates. Instead, autaxys is an ongoing, active process of self-unfolding, self-organization, and continuous pattern generation. Reality, therefore, is in a constant state of becoming, its evolution driven by the intrinsic dynamics of autaxys. Change is fundamental to this view, and stability is understood as an emergent property of specific patterns that achieve persistence within this overarching flux.

Third, autaxys is **rational and rule-governed**. It operates according to inherent principles of coherence, consistency, and order. This intrinsic rationality can be described as a “meta-logic”—a foundational set of operative principles that are more fundamental than any human-formulated systems of logic or mathematics. Such human systems are then understood as conceptual tools, developed by observing systems (which are themselves complex autaxys patterns) to apprehend, model, and make sense of aspects of this inherent, systemic rationality as it is manifested in the patterns generated by autaxys.

Fourth, autaxys is fundamentally **pattern generating**. The primary mode through which autaxys manifests itself and becomes knowable—that is, capable of being interacted with or detected—is via the generation of discernible, evolving patterns at all conceivable scales of existence. These patterns, which range from the subtle regularities underlying physical laws to the intricate structures of matter and the complex organization of living systems, are the “expressions” or “articulations” of autaxys. They are not separate from autaxys but are its dynamic form and substance.

Fifth, autaxys serves as the **foundation for information (derivative sense)**. What is commonly understood and quantified as *information* (for instance, data, signals, Bateson’s “a difference that makes a difference,” or the constructs of Shannon information) arises when autaxys-generated patterns are registered, detected, processed, or differentiated by an interacting system. Autaxys is the generative source of all potential distinguishability; information, in its various epistemological and communicational senses, is a derivative, map-level concept that reflects aspects of those patterns as they are perceived or measured by other patterns.

Sixth, autaxys exhibits **self-articulation/self-description**. The dynamic unfolding of autaxys and the patterns it generates are not merely effects of some deeper, hidden cause; they *are* its self-expression and, in a profound sense, its ongoing self-description. The structure and evolution of reality *is* the articulation of autaxys. In this view, there is no fundamental distinction between autaxys as a principle and its complete expression as the totality of all patterns and their governing dynamics.

Seventh, a defining characteristic is its **acausal origin (no external agent)** in terms of its fundamental ordering and structuring principles. Autaxys does not rely on a pre-existing, external agent, designer, or set of imposed laws to initiate its activity or dictate its order. The principles governing its behavior and its capacity for self-organization are intrinsic to its nature as a self-generating system.

Finally, there is a **transcendence of Gödelian limits (conceptual aspiration)** associated with autaxys. While any human formal system (a *map*) attempting to describe autaxys comprehensively will inevitably be subject to Gödelian incompleteness, autaxys itself (the *territory-generator*) is conceived as being operationally complete and consistent in its own mode of being and generation. It is the inexhaustible source from which describable, and potentially indescribable, complexity arises.

These characteristics collectively define autaxys as a unique ontological primitive, distinct from traditional notions of substance, mind, or even information when conceived merely as data. It is proposed as the active, self-organizing, pattern-generating foundation of all reality.

## 5. Critical Distinctions: Positioning Autaxys and Autology

To fully appreciate the conceptual space that autaxys and autology are intended to occupy, it is crucial to distinguish them from several existing, influential concepts. These distinctions are not necessarily oppositional but aim to clarify the unique contributions and foundational claims of the autaxys framework.

### 5.1 Autaxys versus Information (General and Shannon Information)

While the research lineage leading to autaxys has strong information-theoretic roots, and autaxys itself is the generator of all discernible patterns (which, when registered, constitute information), autaxys as an ontological principle is posited as prior to and more fundamental than information in its common epistemological or communicational senses.

A primary distinction must be made with **Shannon Information**. The mathematical theory of communication developed by Claude Shannon, known as Shannon Information, quantifies uncertainty reduction, channel capacity, and the statistical properties of signals and data. This is an indispensable tool for analyzing the transmission and processing of patterns once they have been generated by autaxys and registered by some system. However, Shannon Information theory does not address the origin or ontological status of the patterns themselves, nor the nature of the system generating them. Autaxys is proposed as that generative system; Shannon Information helps describe aspects of its derivative expressions.

A broader, more qualitative understanding of information, such as Gregory Bateson’s concept of “a difference that makes a difference,” is closer to the manifestations of autaxys, as autaxys is the source of all distinguishability. A pattern generated by autaxys, when it interacts with another pattern or an observing system, creates a “difference that makes a difference.” However, autaxys is not merely the sum of such differences or the capacity for distinction; it is the underlying dynamic principle that *generates* these differences and the systemic context within which they become meaningful or consequential. Information, in this Batesonian sense, is a relational property that emerges from the interaction of autaxys-generated patterns.

Therefore, regarding ontological status, autaxys is proposed as the fundamental, active, self-generating reality—the *territory-generator*. Information, in its various common usages, describes aspects, states, or registered patterns *of* or *from* autaxys—it pertains to the “map” or the interface with the territory.

### 5.2 Autaxys versus Classical *Logos*

While *logos* shares connotations of order, reason, and cosmic principle, autaxys specifically emphasizes the *self-generating, self-arranging, and systemic* nature of this principle. It aims for a naturalistic framework, distinct from specific theological or purely abstract philosophical interpretations of *logos*, by grounding the origin of order within the principle itself.

### 5.3 Autaxys versus Matter or Energy as Primary Substance

Traditional materialism or physicalism posits matter and/or energy as the fundamental substances of reality, with all phenomena, including order and information, being properties or arrangements of this primary stuff. Autaxys reverses this ontological hierarchy. In the autaxys framework, what we perceive and measure as matter and energy are not fundamental substances but rather highly stable, complex, and persistently interacting patterns generated by the dynamics of autaxys. Their properties (mass, charge, solidity, energetic states) are emergent characteristics of these autaxys-generated patterns and their interactions. Physicality itself is an emergent quality of robust, inter-subjectively verifiable patterns.

### 5.4 Autaxys versus Mind or Consciousness as Primary

Idealist philosophies, in various forms, posit mind, consciousness, or mental phenomena as fundamental, with the physical world being a construct or manifestation of mind. Autaxys offers a different non-materialist foundation. While autaxys is non-material, it is not inherently mentalistic in the idealist sense. Mind and consciousness are viewed within autology as exceptionally complex emergent phenomena arising within specific types of highly organized, information-processing patterns generated by autaxys (e.g., biological organisms with sophisticated nervous systems). They are highly evolved expressions of autaxys, not its source.

### 5.5 Autology versus Existing Disciplines

Autology, as the study of autaxys, is conceived as a foundational, interdisciplinary field that can inform and potentially reframe aspects of existing disciplines, rather than simply replacing them. For instance, autology seeks to provide the ontological grounding for the patterns and laws that physics describes, asking *why* those particular patterns and laws (as expressions of autaxys) exist. In relation to information science and theory, autology provides a candidate for the source of the “information” that these fields quantify and study the processing of. For systems theory and complexity science, autology offers a fundamental principle (autaxys) whose dynamics inherently lead to the complex, self-organizing systems that these fields investigate. Finally, autology directly engages with and proposes new answers to core philosophical questions in metaphysics (regarding the nature of reality, with autaxys as primary) and epistemology (concerning the nature and limits of knowledge, particularly how we can know autaxys through its patterns).

By clarifying these distinctions, the unique conceptual territory claimed by autaxys and autology can be better understood, facilitating a more productive engagement with their proposed framework.

## 6. Philosophical Implications of an Autaxys-Centric Framework (Preliminary)

The introduction of autaxys as a fundamental ontological principle carries with it significant philosophical implications, prompting a re-evaluation of core concepts in metaphysics, epistemology, and scientific methodology. While a full exploration of these consequences will be undertaken in more extensive works (such as the monograph “A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autaxys” and the critical analysis “The Limits of Legacy: An Autological Critique of Conventional Scientific Wisdom and Methodology”), this section provides a preliminary outline of the major shifts suggested by an autaxys-centric worldview.

In ontology, the primary implication is a shift away from substance metaphysics—the view that reality is composed of some fundamental “stuff” (like matter or mind)—towards a process-and-pattern-based ontology. If autaxys, as a self-ordering and pattern-generating system, is fundamental, then existence itself is redefined. To exist means to be a discernible, persistent pattern generated by and participating in the dynamics of autaxys. Entities are not static things but stable processes or configurations of interacting patterns. This perspective offers new ways to approach the nature of physical objects, fields, and even abstract concepts, viewing them all as different kinds or scales of autaxys-generated patterns.

Epistemologically, an autaxys framework challenges naive realism and reframes the nature of knowledge. If reality is fundamentally autaxys and we only ever interact with its manifested patterns, then all observation is a mediated process of pattern detection and interpretation. Knowledge is therefore not a direct apprehension of an independent, pre-structured external world, but rather the construction of coherent and predictively successful models of these autaxys-generated patterns. The “truth” of such models lies in their efficacy in describing observed regularities and guiding interaction, rather than in a one-to-one correspondence with some underlying material substance. This view also has implications for understanding the role of mathematics and logic; these are not seen as intrinsic laws that autaxys “obeys,” but as sophisticated conceptual tools developed by pattern-recognizing systems (like human minds, themselves autaxys-constructs) to describe the inherent rationality and structural consistencies of autaxys and its manifestations.

Methodologically, the autaxys perspective encourages a shift in scientific inquiry. While empirical observation of patterns remains paramount, the focus of explanation moves towards identifying the underlying generative principles of autaxys that give rise to these patterns. It calls for an approach that emphasizes the discovery of fundamental rules of self-organization and emergence, rather than solely cataloging phenomena or seeking ultimate material constituents. Furthermore, it brings into question the absolute status of current scientific “laws,” viewing them as highly effective descriptions of observed regularities within a certain domain of autaxys’s expression, but potentially incomplete or emergent from deeper, more foundational autaxys principles. This also impacts the understanding of falsifiability, suggesting that anomalies or predictions from a coherent, principle-based framework (like those potentially arising from autology) that conflict with established models may indicate limitations in those models rather than immediate falsification of the new framework.

These preliminary implications highlight the transformative potential of an autaxys-centric view, suggesting new avenues for inquiry across the philosophical landscape and a re-grounding of our understanding of reality itself.

## 7. Synthesis: Autaxys and Autology as Cornerstones for a New Perspective

This document has endeavored to lay a precise and robust conceptual foundation by introducing **autaxys** as the fundamental, self-ordering, and pattern-generating principle of reality, alongside **autology** as the interdisciplinary field dedicated to its systematic study. The careful construction of these terms, rooted in etymological significance and driven by the identified inadequacies of existing vocabularies, is intended to provide the necessary clarity for a rigorous re-examination of existence itself.

The detailed definitions and elaborated characteristics of autaxys—its ontological primacy, dynamic processual nature, intrinsic rationality, pattern-generating capacity, and self-articulating dynamics—aim to establish it as a unique and potent ontological primitive. By distinguishing autaxys from conventional understandings of information, classical *logos*, matter, or mind as primary, this framework seeks to carve out a distinct theoretical space for exploring a reality grounded in inherent, self-driven order.

The establishment of autaxys and autology is more than a terminological adjustment; it is a strategic imperative for the broader research program. These concepts are designed to serve as the unwavering bedrock for the arguments and reinterpretations to be developed in the monograph “A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autaxys” (D001). They will inform the architecture of the “autaxic table of pattern-based reality” (D003), provide the lens for validating and contextualizing the î₁ pattern (D004), and sharpen the critical analysis of conventional scientific wisdom (D005).

The path into autology is an invitation to cultivate a new mode of inquiry, one that prioritizes the discernment of intrinsic order and the principles of emergent complexity. This foundational exposition of autaxys and autology aims to equip that inquiry with the precise conceptual tools required for such an ambitious undertaking. The ultimate aspiration is to foster a deeper, more unified, and fundamentally more coherent understanding of the cosmos and our role within it as systems uniquely capable of perceiving and modeling the very patterns from which we arise.
