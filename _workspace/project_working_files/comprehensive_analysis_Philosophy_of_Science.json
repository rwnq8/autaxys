Understanding the Foundational Crisis,\" from *Philosophy of Science* by Rowan Brad Quni, argues that despite the immense predictive success of modern physics theories like Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, and the Standard Model, they suffer from a profound conceptual crisis. This crisis, characterized by paradoxes, ambiguities, and incompatibilities, suggests a fundamental inadequacy in their underlying metaphysical and methodological assumptions. The text contends that addressing this requires engaging with philosophy, specifically Metaphysics, Epistemology, and Logic, which provide the necessary tools for conceptual clarification, critical evaluation of assumptions, and guiding the search for new frameworks. The work is structured around key philosophical questions, using physics as evidence, to demonstrate the necessity of philosophical rigor for understanding and resolving the foundational problems in physics.",

Quantum mechanics introduces irreducible probability (Born rule) and non-locality, while the Arrow of Time is shown to be statistical, relying on the Past Hypothesis, not deterministic laws. The text re-evaluates the nature of physical laws and causality, suggesting they are better understood as statistical patterns, propensities, or structural constraints rather than deterministic dictates. It concludes that the classical deterministic-causal worldview is fundamentally inadequate for describing reality.",

It connects these limits to computational undecidability, exemplified by Alan Turing's Halting Problem, and classic paradoxes like Russell's and the Liar. The text discusses valid philosophical implications regarding the limits of formalism and cautions against common misinterpretations in other domains.",

The work argues that modern physics, despite its predictive success, faces a profound foundational and conceptual crisis rooted in inadequate classical metaphysical and methodological assumptions. The book systematically uses insights from quantum mechanics, general relativity, thermodynamics, and cosmology to challenge core classical concepts such as scientific realism, materialism, the nature of time, determinism, locality, continuous spacetime, objectivity, and the nature of scientific explanation. It posits that addressing this crisis requires rigorous philosophical analysis, particularly from metaphysics, epistemology, and logic, to clarify concepts, evaluate assumptions, and guide the search for new frameworks. The chapters build upon each other, first diagnosing the crisis, then establishing a philosophical toolkit, and subsequently applying this toolkit to critique specific classical assumptions challenged by modern physics, advocating for a revision of our fundamental understanding of reality and scientific knowledge.",
