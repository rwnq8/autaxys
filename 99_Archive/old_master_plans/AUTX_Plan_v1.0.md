  task_sequencing_notes: "Core definitional work (D002, Primer KA) is prioritized. D001 (Monograph) development will be substantial and iterative. D003 (Autaxic Table) can proceed once core autaxys principles for pattern generation are clearer. D004 (Î₁ & PDG) builds on D003. D005 (Critique) can be developed in parallel with D001 or draw from its conclusions. KA Management (T002_AUTX_KA_Management) is ongoing."
  resource_plan_notes: "Primary resources are Author (conceptual direction, review, final writing) and AI (synthesis, drafting, refinement assistance). Access to all prior project documentation (Infomatics, ITPR lineage, QNFO docs) is critical."
  quality_plan_notes: "Quality ensured through: strict adherence to AUTX_StyleGuide_v1.4, AUTX_Glossary_v1.3, AUTX_AutaxysPrimer_v2.2; iterative KS/O/D/R cycles with Author approval at each stage; AI self-critique using MetaRefineOutputASO on drafts; alignment with AUTX_SuccessMetrics_v1.2 for deliverables."

  change_management_process: "Minor changes to task details managed flexibly. Significant changes to scope (from AUTX_Charter_v1.5), core methodology, or major deliverable structure require explicit re-confirmation and potential Plan/Charter update. All key decisions logged."
  methodology_specific_planning: "The 'Iterative Conceptual Development, Argumentative Synthesis, and Deliverable-Focused Framework Construction (AI-Assisted)' methodology is implemented via the KS/O/D/R cycle for each deliverable component, strong reliance on foundational KAs, and iterative refinement based on Author feedback. The 'Four Pillars' structure guides D001 Part I."
  internal_review_summary: "Plan v1.1 for AUTX drafted. WBS prioritizes foundational definitional work (D002, Primer) followed by the major monograph (D001) and other key deliverables (D003-D005). Structure allows for focused development of each piece while ensuring conceptual coherence. Risks and quality measures from Charter integrated. Capitalization in titles and headings corrected. Plan seems robust for this ambitious project."
