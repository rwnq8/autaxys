    initial_user_prompt: "Project reset initiated. Entire preceding dialogue (including original ITPR exploration, Autologos development, critique of physicality, four-pillar structure, etc.) serves as the comprehensive exploration input for this new project definition. Key documents provided by user ('Infomatics.md', 'Lineage of Information-Based Physics.md', 'Comparing Fundamental Frameworks.md', '25133063723.md', '25129114949.md', '25129115332.md') are part of this input."
    core_problem_summary: "Current physical paradigms are incomplete and fail to explain the fundamental nature of reality, particularly the origin of particles and their properties. The î₁ 'infoton' prediction, while problematic under old frameworks, points towards a deeper, pattern-based reality governed by principles like Ratio Resonance, which needs to be formalized under the 'autaxys' concept. The task is to develop this autaxys framework, validate/contextualize î₁, and construct an 'autaxic table' (at/atpbr)."
