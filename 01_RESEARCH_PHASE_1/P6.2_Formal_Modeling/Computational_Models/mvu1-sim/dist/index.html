        <h1>Autaxys Generative Engine: The Definitive Research Instrument</h1>

            <summary>Scientific Mission and Methodology</summary>
            <div class="docs-content">
                <h3>The Autaxys/Autaxic Max Principle: A Truly Self-Generating Universe</h3>
                <p>This workbench is the definitive instrument for testing the core tenets of the Autaxys framework. It has been re-architected to meet the highest standards of scientific and philosophical rigor: **it contains no hardcoded physical constants or arbitrary parameters.**</p>
                <p>The simulation starts from a true void (an empty graph) and evolves based on a single, fundamental drive: **to maximize its own Ontological Closure (OC).** This is modeled by seeking higher "S-Levels" of stability, from simple fixed points (S₁) to complex, adaptive structures (S₆), as outlined in the Autaxys Unified Framework (`D-P6.7-1_Unified_Framework_v1.9.md`).</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>The Core Hypothesis</h3>
                <blockquote>Can a system, starting from nothing and governed only by a drive to achieve more robust and complex forms of self-consistency, spontaneously generate the hierarchical structures and dynamic laws we observe in reality?</blockquote>
                <p>An "honest win" is any result this simulation produces. If it consistently reaches high S-Levels, the hypothesis is supported. If it consistently gets trapped in simple states or dissolves, that is an equally valuable scientific result, indicating the core principles need refinement.</p>
                <hr>
                <h3>The Evolution of the Model: A Record of Intellectual Honesty</h3>
                <p>A scientific instrument is defined not only by its final state but by the documented process of its refinement. Initial versions of this model contained critical flaws and "magic numbers" that were ultimately indefensible. The following principles were added iteratively to address these blind spots and create a truly rigorous simulation.</p>
                <div class="evolution-log">
                    <h4>Initial Flaw: Arbitrary "Magic Numbers"</h4>
                    <p><b>Correction:</b> All external physical constants were removed. The universe's properties and its lifespan are now emergent results of the simulation, not inputs.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Initial Flaw: Premature Halting (The Fizzle)</h4>
                    <p><b>Correction:</b> The principles of **Forward Momentum** (allowing neutral-coherence moves) and the **Eternal Return** (re-igniting from a failed state) were implemented to ensure the system has every chance to find a path to complexity.</p>

                    <h4>Initial Flaw: The Tyranny of Immediate Optimization</h4>
                    <p><b>Correction: The Exploration Drive.</b> The simulation now incorporates a crucial principle for escaping trivial states. When the universe is in a simple, low-coherence state, it has a higher probability of taking "risky" or exploratory moves that may not be immediately optimal. This drive diminishes as the system becomes more complex and stable. This allows it to "invest" in complexity for a greater future payoff.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="speculative-hypothesis">
                    <h4>New Speculative Principle Under Test: Emergent Laws and Foresight</h4>
                    <p>The **Exploration Drive** is a profound extension to the Autaxys framework. It implies that the universe possesses a rudimentary form of **memory** (basing its "risk tolerance" on its current state) and **foresight** (making a short-term sacrifice for a potential long-term gain). This suggests that self-generation may not be a simple, linear optimization but a more complex, dual-process dynamic involving both short-term exploitation and long-term exploration, analogous to what Daniel Kahneman calls "Thinking, Fast and Slow." This workbench is now designed to test if this dual-process model is a necessary component for the emergence of complex, hierarchical structures from a true void.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Final Scientific Methodology</h3>
                <p>The current workbench employs the following best practices:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>S-Level Maximization</dt>
                    <dd>The simulation's core driver is a multi-objective function that seeks to maximize the Ontological Closure level (S-Level), then its robustness, while minimizing its complexity (The Economy of Existence).</dd>
                    <dt>Emergent Properties &amp; Laws</dt>
                    <dd>Core particle properties (`valence`) and even the effectiveness of the rules themselves (`ruleWeights`) are dynamic and emerge from the simulation's history and state.</dd>
                    <dt>Dynamic Batch Analysis</dt>
                    <dd>The number of simulations is not fixed. The analysis controller runs simulations in increments until the results converge and a 95% statistical confidence interval on the mean final S-Level is achieved. This minimizes **Type I errors (false positives)**.</dd>
                    <dt>Weighted Averaging</dt>
                    <dd>The final aggregated plot is a weighted average. Runs that achieve higher complexity and stability are given more weight, providing a more honest picture of the system's true potential.</dd>
                </dl>
