It argues that computation, while a powerful 'third pillar' of inquiry, introduces 'implied discretization'—an unavoidable imposition of granularity due to finite-precision arithmetic and discrete representation. This discrepancy is not a minor issue but a significant limitation impacting the reliability and interpretation of results across scientific and engineering domains, particularly for sensitive systems like chaos or complex models like AI. The text outlines the structure of the analysis, which will delve into historical context, technical mechanics (like the IEEE 754 standard), scope across disciplines, mitigation strategies, and philosophical implications.",

The book traces the historical context, details the mechanics (like IEEE 754 floating-point), analyzes domain-specific impacts across science and engineering, evaluates mitigation strategies and their limitations, and delves into the profound philosophical implications regarding the limits of computational knowledge and scientific realism.
