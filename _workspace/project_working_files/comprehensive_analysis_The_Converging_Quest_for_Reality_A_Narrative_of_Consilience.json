It proposes a comparative exploration of how humanity has sought to understand reality, knowledge, and existence across diverse cultural and disciplinary boundaries, from ancient myths and philosophies (East and West) to modern science. The narrative will delve into key themes such as ontological foundations, cosmogenesis, time, causality, scientific epistemology, consciousness, and the drive for unification, seeking points of consilience where different modes of inquiry illuminate common questions. The goal is to construct a unified account of this dynamic intellectual evolution.",

It then discusses the shift initiated by Greek philosophy, seeking rational principles (*arche*) instead of divine caprice. Finally, it covers modern scientific cosmology, focusing on the *Big Bang theory* and *cosmic inflation*, which use mathematical models and empirical data. The text highlights the persistent human drive to understand origins, noting how scientific models, while powerful, still face limits like the initial singularity, leaving fundamental questions open.",

It delves into key themes such as ontological foundations (substance, process, emptiness), cosmogenesis, time, causality, scientific epistemology, consciousness, and the drive for unification. The narrative seeks 'consilience' by highlighting points where disparate paths of inquiry converge or productively challenge one another, particularly noting unexpected resonances between modern physics and Eastern philosophical traditions. The goal is to construct a unified account of this dynamic intellectual evolution.",
