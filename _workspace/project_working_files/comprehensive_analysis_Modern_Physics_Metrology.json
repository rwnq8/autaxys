      "summary": "This introduction to *Modern Physics Metrology* by Rowan Brad Quni argues that modern fundamental physics and cosmology are built on potentially flawed foundations: the SI unit system and conventional mathematical frameworks. It posits that fixing fundamental constants like c and h has created a closed, self-referential system detached from empirical reality regarding its own premises. The work contends this system is a \"house of cards\" where discrepancies, like the need for dark matter and dark energy, are interpreted as requiring new entities rather than indicating foundational errors. The book promises a systematic deconstruction of this edifice, analyzing number systems, the SI system's self-referential loops, and demonstrating how these flaws propagate, arguing they explain the apparent necessity of the \"dark sector.\"",

    "consolidatedBatchSummary": "This batch of documents constitutes *Modern Physics Metrology* by Rowan Brad Quni (2025). The work presents a fundamental critique of the current foundations of physics, arguing that the standard mathematical frameworks (like base-10, zero, linearity) and the modern SI unit system, particularly its definition of units by fixing fundamental constants (c, h), create a self-referential system detached from empirical reality regarding its own premises. The author contends this system enshrines anthropocentric biases and historical contingencies, leading to theoretical inconsistencies and the apparent necessity of phenomena like dark matter and dark energy, which are proposed to be artifacts of the flawed measurement and descriptive toolkit rather than real entities. The book advocates for grounding physics in fundamental dimensionless geometric constants like Pi and Phi and using ratios over decimal approximations to build a more robust and parsimonious framework.",

      "The central thesis is that the act of fixing fundamental constants within the SI system creates a 'metrological loop' that prevents empirical testing of the very theories from which those constants were derived, thereby insulating paradigms and generating apparent paradoxes.",
