It contrasts how we perceive a rock (tangible, multi-sensory) with how we infer the existence of a photon (via cumulative effects/instrumental patterns) and a neutrino (primarily a theoretical construct inferred from complex data). The text argues that the conventional understanding of particles as discrete \"bits of stuff\" is limited, especially in the quantum realm. It suggests that the commonality binding these disparate entities might be their nature as recognizable, reproducible patterns, laying the groundwork for a pattern-based ontology of reality.",

Examples from microscopy, astronomy, and particle physics (like the Higgs boson discovery) illustrate how scientific 'seeing' is a sophisticated act of pattern recognition within complex data, interpreted through theoretical frameworks.

It proposes Autaxys as a foundational alternative, presenting an autaxic cosmogony that describes the universe's self-generation from primordial potentiality. The narrative traces cosmic evolution through phases: primordial differentiation, emergence of fundamental particles and nuclei (Autaxic BBN), structure formation (stars, galaxies, cosmic web), and the creation of preconditions for life. Autaxys aims to explain observed dynamics, including those attributed to the 'dark sector,' as consequences of its intrinsic principles and emergent gravity, offering a more parsimonious account.",

    "consolidatedBatchSummary": "This batch comprises the initial chapters of *A New Way of Seeing: Autaxys as a Framework for Pattern-Based Reality, from Rocks to Neutrinos* by Rowan Brad Quni (2025). The first six chapters (Part I) systematically deconstruct conventional 'seeing' and understanding of reality, highlighting limitations imposed by the 'Particle Paradox', biological perception's 'Constructed Panorama', the 'Instrumental Veil', the 'Imprint of Mind', and the resulting 'Contours of Ignorance'. Chapter 6 explores cognitive mechanisms, including those from contemplative practices, that can modulate perception. This critical foundation sets the stage for Part II, beginning with Chapter 7, which formally introduces 'Autaxys' as a novel ontological primitive—a dynamic, self-ordering, pattern-generating principle proposed as the fundamental basis of reality, offering a 'new way of seeing' beyond substance-based ontologies.",

      "Chapter 6 on cognitive mechanisms provides a potential link between the critique of conventional perception and the adoption of a 'new way of seeing' based on Autaxys, suggesting that internal cognitive shifts are necessary.",
      "Chapter 7 directly follows the critique of limitations, presenting 'Autaxys' as the proposed fundamental principle that underpins the pattern-based reality hinted at in earlier chapters."
