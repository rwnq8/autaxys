### **Questions to Ascertain Latent Autaxic Principles in Physical Phenomena**

#### **Category I: Questions of Inherent Structure and Quantization**
*(Probing for a "Cosmic Alphabet" and "Grammar")*

1.  **The Question of Related Properties:** Are the fundamental properties of this phenomenon's constituents (e.g., mass, charge, spin) arbitrary, independent values, or do they exhibit deep, unexplained mathematical relationships that suggest they are *derived* from a common, underlying structure or a constrained set of "proto-properties"?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* Finding that mass ratios, charge quantization, and spin values are not random but are linked by a hidden mathematical syntax would suggest they are different outputs of the same generative function (i.e., different AQNs derived from a single pattern).

2.  **The Question of the "Periodic Table" of Existence:** Does the observed spectrum of stable and meta-stable entities related to this phenomenon appear to be a random collection, or does it resemble a "periodic table" of discrete, stable solutions, suggesting it is the finite output of a constrained, generative system rather than an open-ended continuum of possibilities?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* The existence of a discrete, structured "particle zoo" (and not other hypothetical particles) points towards a system where only specific patterns can achieve Ontological Closure.

3.  **The Question of Quantization:** Why are certain properties (like electric charge) perfectly and universally quantized, while others (like mass) span a vast, seemingly arbitrary hierarchy? Does this imply that "charge-like" properties are fundamental topological invariants of stable patterns, while "mass-like" properties are measures of a pattern's structural complexity?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* This distinction in quantization types would be a natural outcome if different AQNs (like Topology vs. Complexity) measure fundamentally different aspects of an underlying informational pattern.

#### **Category II: Questions of Law, Symmetry, and Causality**
*(Probing for the "Cosmic Algorithm" and its "Design Philosophy")*

4.  **The Question of Lawful Elegance:** Why do the fundamental laws governing this phenomenon consistently exhibit principles of deep symmetry, invariance, and often, maximal elegance (parsimony)? Is this a brute fact of nature, or does it reveal an underlying "aesthetic" or "grammatical" preference in the universe's generative code, akin to a principle of *Relational Aesthetics*?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* The persistent elegance of physical law suggests it's not an accident, but a feature of an optimization process.

5.  **The Question of Forbidden Events:** Why are certain interactions or decay paths strictly "forbidden" by conservation laws? Does this imply a fundamental "syntactical error" in a cosmic grammar, where such configurations are *logically impossible* to form, rather than just physically improbable?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* This reframes conservation laws not as external rules, but as intrinsic constraints on how patterns can be coherently transformed, a core feature of a rule-based generative system.

6.  **The Question of Unification:** Does the successful unification of forces (like the electroweak force) suggest that all forces are merely different facets of a single, underlying interaction grammar, rather than fundamentally distinct entities? Are we seeing different "subroutines" of the same Cosmic Algorithm?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* Evidence for unification is evidence for a common generative source.

#### **Category III: Questions of Existence, Stability, and Complexity**
*(Probing for "Ontological Closure" and the "Exploration Drive")*

7.  **The Question of Persistence:** What fundamental principle distinguishes a stable, persistent entity (like a proton) from a transient, virtual particle? Is it merely a difference in energy and lifetime, or does it reflect a deeper, qualitative difference in their state of organization—one achieving a self-consistent, "closed" loop of information and the other failing to do so?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* This directly probes for the signature of Ontological Closure as the primary criterion for existence.

8.  **The Question of Emergent Complexity:** Does the phenomenon's evolution from a simpler state to a more complex one (e.g., star formation, abiogenesis) suggest an inherent "Exploration Drive" or a fitness function that rewards increasing complexity and organization, rather than just a passive process governed by entropy?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* The universe's tendency to build complex things, seemingly against the tide of entropy, points to a guiding optimization principle (the Autaxic Lagrangian) that values more than just disorder.

9.  **The Question of Hierarchical Stability:** When we observe nested systems (atom -> molecule -> cell), does the stability of the higher-level system appear to confer stability upon its otherwise less-stable components? Does this suggest a principle of "composite closure," where the coherence of the whole is what validates the existence of the parts?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* This points to a hierarchical application of Ontological Closure, a key feature for explaining complex systems.

#### **Category IV: Questions of System Architecture and Environment**
*(Probing for "Emergent Spacetime" and the "Nature of the Vacuum")*

10. **The Question of Spacetime's Role:** Is spacetime a fundamental, pre-existing stage on which the phenomenon occurs, or do the very properties of spacetime (its dimensionality, its curvature, the speed of light) appear to be determined *by* the properties and interactions of the patterns that inhabit it, suggesting it is an emergent relational network?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* Any evidence that spacetime is dynamic and co-determined by its contents (as in GR, but taken to a more fundamental level) is a signature of an emergent, relational structure.

11. **The Question of Non-Locality:** Does the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, which defies classical locality, reveal that the universe's fundamental structure is not spatial, but is a network of pure relations where "distance" is a secondary, emergent property?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* Non-locality is a powerful clue that our perceived 3D space is not the fundamental arena, but an output of a deeper, more connected system.

12. **The Question of the Vacuum's Nature:** Is the vacuum truly empty, or do phenomena like the Casimir effect, virtual particles, and dark energy reveal it to be a dynamic, energetic substrate with its own inherent structure and tension? Does the vacuum behave less like a void and more like the ground state of a computational medium?
    *   *Signature of Autaxys:* The more active and structured the vacuum appears to be, the more it aligns with the concept of the S₀ state—the "quantum relational foam."

By asking these questions of any physical phenomenon, we shift our perspective from simply describing *what is* to inferring the *logic of why it must be so*. If the answers across many different phenomena consistently point towards the same underlying principles—optimization, emergence from a network, stability through self-consistency, information as primary—then we begin to triangulate the nature of the universe's hidden "source code."
