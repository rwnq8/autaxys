#       **Attempt 2.3: Resolution Resonance (Infomatics v3.2 Context)**
#         - **Methodology Description:** This approach hypothesized that particle stability might arise from a specific resonance condition involving exponents of φ and π, potentially related to how different "resolutions" or scales of informational structures interact. The core mathematical condition explored was of the form:
#           $$ \phi^m \approx \pi^{n+q} $$
#           where `m` and `n` were the primary scaling and cyclical indices respectively, and `q` was a small integer (often ±1, ±2, or 0), representing a "quantum shift" or an interaction term modifying the π-related exponent. The idea was that a match between the φ-scaled magnitude and a (possibly shifted) π-scaled cyclical characteristic would define a stable state.
#         - **Specifics Explored (as per `Appendix J` and `Key Steps.md`):**
#             a. Systematic testing of (m, n, q) integer triplets to find approximate equalities.
#             b. Attempts to link specific (m,n,q) solutions to the target 'm' indices {2, 4, 5, 11, 13, 19} and to see if meaningful 'n' and 'q' values emerged.
#             c. Investigation into whether the 'n+q' term could be related to spin or other quantum numbers. For instance, if n+q=0 (i.e., $\phi^m \approx \pi^0 = 1$), this might imply a purely φ-resonant scalar state. If n+q=1 (i.e., $\phi^m \approx \pi$), this might imply a primary π-cycle resonance.
#         - **Objective:** To find a selective principle based on this "Resolution Resonance" condition that could identify the (n,m) pairs of stable particles and potentially offer insights into their properties via the 'q' parameter or the structure of 'n+q'.
#         - **Targeted Properties for Connection:** Primarily mass (via 'm'), but also exploring if 'n+q' could be systematically linked to spin.
#         - **Outcome (as per `Appendix J`, `Key Steps.md`):** This approach was also deemed unsuccessful and was a significant contributor to the "Electron Puzzle."
#         - **Reasons for Outcome (Contemporary Assessment from Source Logs):**
#             1.  **The "Electron Puzzle" Intensified:** A critical failure point was that this model, like some earlier ones, tended to predict that the lowest or simplest solutions (e.g., those with small 'm' and where 'n+q' might be 0 or 1, implying low cyclical complexity) would correspond to Spin=0 (scalar) particles. If the electron (Spin=1/2) was associated with a low 'm' value (like m=5 from the target set), the framework struggled to explain why a more fundamental (simpler n+q) scalar state wasn't observed as the lightest stable charged particle. The model predicted $\phi^5 \approx \pi^2$ (m=5, n+q=2, if $\ln(\phi)/\ln(\pi) \approx (n+q)/m = 2/5 = 0.4$, then $m/(n+q) = 5/2 = 2.5$, close to $\ln(\pi)/\ln(\phi) \approx 2.37$). If k' (from later Ratio Resonance) is analogous to n+q, then k'=2 implies S=1/2. However, simpler solutions like $\phi^m \approx 1$ (n+q=0) would imply S=-1/2 by that analogy, which is unphysical, or if S was simply (n+q)/2, then S=0 for n+q=0, and S=1/2 for n+q=1. The precise mapping to spin was problematic, but simpler solutions often pointed to scalars being more fundamental than the electron.
#             2.  **Lack of Clear Spin Derivation:** No robust rule emerged from the (n,m,q) structure to consistently assign observed spin quantum numbers, especially half-integer spins for fermions, without ad-hoc assignments.
#             3.  **Selectivity and Parameter Freedom:** The introduction of the third integer 'q' increased the parameter space, making it easier to find approximate numerical "resonances" but reducing the predictive power and increasing the risk of fitting to noise or numerology. The criteria for what constituted a "significant" resonance were not sufficiently constrained.
#             4.  **Physical Interpretation of 'q':** The physical meaning of the 'q' parameter remained obscure, making it difficult to justify its role or specific integer values from first principles.
