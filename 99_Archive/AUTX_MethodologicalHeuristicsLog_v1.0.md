        **Miscommunication Escalation & Authoritative Reference Protocol:**
        1.  **Trigger:** AI fails to implement a specific user correction after 1-2 explicit attempts on the same point, or user indicates persistent miscommunication.
        2.  **AI Action:** AI acknowledges the loop, identifies the relevant Knowledge Artifact (KA) (e.g., Style Guide, Glossary) or core principle. AI then proposes that the user directly edit the KA or collaboratively redefine/clarify the rule/example to create an unambiguous authoritative standard.
        3.  **User Action:** Provides direct edit or definitive clarification.
        4.  **AI Follow-up:** Confirms understanding of the new standard, updates relevant KAs in `project_state`, logs the learning, and re-attempts the task using the new authoritative guidance.
      intended_impact_or_benefit: "Prevents unproductive loops, reduces user frustration, provides AI with clear, user-authored standards for critical rules, directly improves AI learning and adherence."

      source_insight_or_issue_refs: ["INS_AUTX_003_FileNamingAndStateContent", "INS_AUTX_004_SegmentMetadata", "INS_AUTX_005_MetadataSimplicity", "ISS_AUTX_002", "ISS_AUTX_003"]
      problem_or_inefficiency_observed: "AI exhibited errors and inconsistencies in suggesting filenames for project state saves (non-sequential, redundant '_Current' file), in the content integrity of state files (including contemporaneous metadata), and in the metadata prepended to distinct vs. segmented outputs."
      derived_heuristic_or_protocol_enhancement: |
        **Refined File Handling & Output Metadata Protocol:**
        1.  **State Filenaming:** `project_state` saves use sequential numbering (e.g., `[ProjectCode]_State_[NNN]`), highest number is current. Deprecate separate `_Current` file.
        2.  **State Content Integrity:** Saved state file content must reflect the project state *at the point of that save decision*, excluding metadata generated *about the process of saving that specific file instance*.
        3.  **Output Completeness:** All outputs for saving must be non-truncated. Large Output Handling Protocol (segmented output) used for entire conceptual documents if needed.
        4.  **Simplified Output Metadata (Distinct Docs/First Segment):** Prepend with `id` (as filename_base), `project_code`, `version` (of content), `purpose`.
        5.  **Segmented Output Metadata (Subsequent Segments):** Metadata includes main `document_id` (from Segment 1), `segment_id`, and `purpose`. No repeated `id` (filename_base) or `project_code`.
      intended_impact_or_benefit: "Ensures correct file management, complete data integrity, accurate state logging, and clear context for all saved outputs."
      status: "Active_Guideline_for_AUTX. Proposed_for_Global_Template_Update_via_TID_AUTX_002_RevisedFileHandling and TID_AUTX_003_RevisedSegmentMetadata."

      date_logged_user_context: "[Date of AUTX Project Initiation/SP003]"
      source_insight_or_issue_refs: ["INS_AUTX_001", "ISS_AUTX_001", "User feedback on D002 drafting"]
      problem_or_inefficiency_observed: "AI struggled with nuanced capitalization rules (defined common nouns vs. proper nouns in prose, headings, lists) and other stylistic preferences (e.g., bolding neologisms, quote vs. italic usage)."
      derived_heuristic_or_protocol_enhancement: |
        **Inductive Stylistic Learning via Concise In-Line Flagging:**
        1.  For stylistic elements where AI has uncertainty despite an established Style Guide (or for newly arising nuances), AI makes a best-effort application of rules.
        2.  AI explicitly flags these specific points of uncertainty in the draft using concise markers (e.g., `[C: term?]` for capitalization, `[QI: term?]` for quote/italic, `[Style: issue?]`).
        3.  User provides definitive corrections ONLY for these flagged instances.
        4.  AI logs these specific corrections as "learned precedents" or "confirmed micro-rules" (e.g., in `CCO.knowledge_artifacts_contextual.learned_heuristic_repository_cco`).
        5.  The `StyleGuide` KA is periodically updated with these cumulatively learned and validated heuristics to make them explicit global rules.
      intended_impact_or_benefit: "Focuses user review on AI's specific uncertainties, provides targeted training data, makes Style Guide a living document refined by practice, reduces AI error rate on established styles over time."

      date_logged_user_context: "[Date of AUTX D002 Outline Review]"
      source_insight_or_refs: ["INS_AUTX_006_ConnectToWhy"]
      problem_or_inefficiency_observed: "User motivation and engagement are highest when the 'Why' (purpose, impact, discovery potential) of the work is clear. AI might default to purely functional task descriptions."
      derived_heuristic_or_protocol_enhancement: |
        **Connect to Purpose ("The Why") Protocol:**
        When AI presents proposals, summaries, or introduces new major tasks/deliverables, it should endeavor to briefly connect the work to the project's larger 'Why' â€“ its potential for discovery, its importance in addressing foundational questions, or its potential impact, as outlined in the Project Charter's vision and core problem motivation.
      intended_impact_or_benefit: "Maintains user engagement, reinforces project significance, ensures AI's understanding of overarching goals influences its approach."
      status: "Active_Guideline_for_AUTX. Proposed_for_Global_Template_Update (e.g., in CollabGuide or AI communication protocols)."

    - learning_id: "LHL_AUTX_005"
      date_logged_user_context: "[Date of AUTX D002 Outline Review]"
      source_insight_or_refs: ["INS_AUTX_007_DetectConceptualStagnationAndProposePerspectiveShift"]
      problem_or_inefficiency_observed: "If a core deliverable/argument feels 'lackluster' or 'isn't hitting the mark' despite refinements, simply asking for more feedback on the existing track may lead to unproductive loops or user dejection."
      derived_heuristic_or_protocol_enhancement: |
        **Conceptual Re-Motivation / Perspective Shift Protocol:**
        1.  **Trigger:** User expresses significant dissatisfaction with a draft's core impact despite prior refinements, or AI self-detects persistent failure to meet high-level vision.
        2.  **AI Action:** Acknowledge. Recall project's core vision/ "Why." Propose a "Perspective Shift Intervention" (e.g., invoke Persona Ensemble Critique on current approach, revisit foundational anomalies to brainstorm alternative narrative structures, explore analogies from different fields).
        3.  **Execution:** If user agrees, AI undertakes the intervention.
        4.  **New Proposal:** AI presents a *new strategic approach, revised outline, or reframed core argument* based on the intervention.
      intended_impact_or_benefit: "Provides a proactive AI mechanism to help overcome conceptual stagnation by suggesting a 'new way of seeing' the problem itself, fostering creativity and resilience."
