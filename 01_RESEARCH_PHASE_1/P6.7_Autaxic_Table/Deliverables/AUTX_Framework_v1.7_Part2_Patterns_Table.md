### 5.0 The Autaxic Quantum Numbers (AQNs): Derived Properties of Stable Patterns

Stable patterns, those that achieve Ontological Closure, possess intrinsic properties determined by the specific way their internal structure satisfies OC. These properties are classified by the Autaxic Quantum Numbers, serving as the fundamental axes of the Autaxic Table. Each AQN is a characteristic *of* a pattern that has achieved OC, and its specific value is determined by the minimal structural requirements and topological constraints imposed by the OC principle and the Cosmic Algorithm for that pattern type, constrained and biased by the inherent proto-properties of the fundamental Distinctions and Relations that constitute the pattern:

5.1 P_ID (Pattern Identifier): A unique symbolic label for each distinct, stable pattern that satisfies OC. Corresponds to the identity of a fundamental particle or stable composite. This is the pattern's fundamental type or 'species' within the relational zoo, akin to a particle family or specific configuration. It represents a specific, self-validating logical structure – a "proof of existence" within the system, a stable solution to the equation of relational self-consistency. It is the emergent identity that crystallizes from the underlying relational flux, a persistent 'name' in the cosmic lexicon, a node in the phase space of stable possibilities. The P_ID is not assigned externally but is an intrinsic label derived from the pattern's unique combination of C, T, and S and its position in the phase space of stable configurations, fundamentally determined by the proto-properties of its constituent D's and R's. It is the pattern's unique signature in the landscape of coherence.

5.2 C (Complexity Order): A quantitative measure of the pattern's structural intricacy – the number of core distinctions, depth of recursion, and density of internal relational activity. This is the primary determinant of mass and energy. It can be seen as a measure of the pattern's internal 'computational state space' size, the amount of relational processing required to instantiate and maintain it, or its logical depth. C is a measure of the pattern's inherent 'busyness' or 'density of meaning'. It quantifies the internal relational 'work' required to uphold the pattern's OC. In the Economy of Existence, C represents the ontological cost of the pattern, the computational resources required for its self-validation. It is the structural 'overhead' required to maintain coherence in a dynamic environment, paid in units of fundamental relational action (*h*). C is constrained by T and S, and fundamentally by the proto-properties of the constituent D's and R's which bias the complexity required for stable configurations. The specific value of C for a stable pattern is the minimal complexity required for its specific T to achieve a particular S level, driven by the Economy of Existence principle. It is the pattern's inherent 'processing load', measured by the minimal rate of D/R operations (*h* units) needed for internal self-validation.

5.3 T (Topological Class): A qualitative classification of the pattern's internal relational graph structure – its connectivity, symmetries, and asymmetries. T defines the fundamental "shape" of the pattern's self-constitution, dictating *how* it achieves OC and how it can relate to other patterns. It encapsulates the essential invariant properties of the pattern's internal network topology under deformation. T dictates the pattern's 'interface signature' for interactions. It is the pattern's unique structural fingerprint that determines its relational potential and its role in the cosmic grammar. T determines properties like charge (asymmetry), spin (rotational symmetry/flow), and particle family type (broader topological categories), all fundamentally rooted in the proto-properties of the D's and R's that form the pattern and the rules governing their combination. T captures the stable, robust features of the pattern's internal relational network that persist despite the constant flux of underlying D/R processing. It's the pattern's enduring form factor in relational space, the topological "DNA" that specifies its identity and potential interactions. T can be formally described using topological invariants (e.g., Betti numbers, knot invariants if relations can form knotted structures, specific group structures describing symmetries). The specific T configurations that are possible are constrained by the fundamental D/R rules, the proto-properties of D and R, and the requirement of minimal C for stability. T is the blueprint for achieving OC, shaped by the inherent qualities of the primitives.

5.4 S (Stability Index): A measure of the pattern's resilience and coherence – how robustly it maintains internal Ontological Closure against potential perturbations and external interactions. S is determined by the specific interplay of C and T for the pattern, and the efficiency of its OC mechanism. Some complex topologies (T) are inherently more stable (S) at a given complexity (C) than others, reflecting the elegance or robustness of their relational structure in resisting dissolution. S is a measure of the pattern's logical robustness or error correction capability against relational noise. It quantifies how 'strongly' the pattern 'wants' to exist in its current form, its resilience against ontological dissolution. In the Economy of Existence, S represents the existential value conferred by the pattern. It is the pattern's capacity to persist and contribute to the overall coherence of the universe. Higher S patterns are more "profitable" in the cosmic economy, requiring less maintenance relative to their longevity. S is the measure of a pattern's success in the cosmic game of self-consistent existence, fundamentally dependent on the proto-properties of its constituent D's and R's and how they interact according to the Cosmic Algorithm rules to achieve persistent closure. S could be quantified by metrics like the depth of the attractor basin in the phase space of relational configurations, the mean time to de-coherence under standard vacuum noise, or the minimum energy/relational perturbation required to break its closure. S is fundamentally limited by C and T; a very simple pattern (C low) or a highly unstable topology (T) cannot achieve arbitrary S. S is the achieved resilience of the OC mechanism, a direct consequence of the specific D/R configuration and their proto-properties.

5.4.1 S quantifies resilience... (This appears to be a placeholder or incomplete sentence from a previous draft. I will remove it in the final generation unless you provide the complete text.)

5.4.2 Types of Ontological Closure (S levels): Mechanisms of Coherence: S is likely not a single number but represents the *mechanism* by which a pattern achieves and maintains closure, reflecting different levels of logical/computational robustness. These levels describe distinct ways a relational structure can be self-consistent and resilient. The specific mechanism is determined by the pattern's C and T and the fundamental rules it utilizes to maintain coherence. The proto-properties of the constituents likely play a role in which mechanism is available or favored.

1.  **S₀: Undifferentiated Potential / Vacuum:** The baseline state of D's and R's (with their proto-properties) before stable patterns emerge. Minimal structured information, maximal potential relational flux. (S=0?) This is the state of pure computational possibility, a sea of unresolved relations. It is the state of maximal relational entropy. It is the ground state of the cosmic computation, always attempting to resolve itself into coherence. Its "mechanism" is a continuous, probabilistic exploration of relational possibilities that do not achieve persistent closure. It is the state of being 'just short' of self-consistency. Its dynamics are governed by the fundamental rules and proto-properties, embodying the inherent probabilistic nature of the ground state.
2.  **S₁: Simple Fixed Point:** The pattern is a static configuration of relations that satisfies closure instantly. Such patterns might be extremely fundamental or represent transient states within the vacuum. (e.g., the simplest R(D,D) loop if it can self-validate, given compatible proto-properties). Minimal stability, easily disrupted by any external relational noise. Requires continuous, but minimal, processing to exist. It is the most basic form of self-consistency, easily overwhelmed. The mechanism is a basic, non-recursive loop of relations that holds itself constant, defined by a minimal C and simple T that satisfies the Validation Rule directly, given the proto-properties. It's a static truth statement.
3.  **S₂: Recursive Structure:** The pattern's closure is achieved through self-referential loops of relations. Its stability depends on the continuous, consistent execution of this internal recursion (e.g., potentially fundamental particles like electrons or quarks *within* a composite). This is a dynamic form of stability, requiring ongoing processing. It's a stable limit cycle in relational state space. Robust against simple perturbations, but vulnerable if the recursive cycle is broken or overwhelmed. Represents stability through self-sustaining computation. It's a pattern that maintains its existence by constantly re-computing itself. The mechanism involves a feedback loop where the output of relational processing reinforces its own input, creating a stable, repeating cycle, requiring a higher C and specific T (compatible with proto-properties) to implement this recursive validation using the Cosmic Algorithm rules. It's a dynamic truth statement that validates itself through repetition.
4.  **S₃: Dynamic Equilibrium/Limit Cycle:** The pattern doesn't settle into a static or simple recursive state, but achieves closure through a stable, repeating cycle of relational transformations. Its existence is a persistent oscillation or transformation cycle (e.g., neutrinos oscillating between flavors, representing a stable limit cycle in relational state space where transitions between slightly different T's maintain overall S). Stability depends on maintaining the cycle; disruptions can break it. It's stability through persistent change. This level embodies stability through dynamic balance. It's a pattern that maintains coherence by constantly transforming its internal state in a cycle. The mechanism involves a set of relational transformations (using Transformation Rules, constrained by proto-properties) that cycle back onto themselves, forming a stable, dynamic equilibrium, requiring a specific T structure that allows for these cyclic transformations while maintaining overall coherence. It's a truth statement that maintains its validity by constantly changing its form within a defined boundary.
5.  **S₄: Composite Stability:** Closure is achieved not by a single pattern but by the coherent composition of multiple patterns according to specific *I_R* (e.g., protons and neutrons from quarks, atoms from nucleons/electrons). The stability (*S*) of the composite system validates the existence of its unstable or compositionally incomplete constituents within that system. This is a higher-order closure mechanism – the system achieves closure at a level above its parts. Stability is robust against perturbations to components if the overall composite structure is maintained. The whole validates the parts. This level represents stability through structured composition. The stability arises from the harmonious interplay and mutual validation of constituent patterns according to *I_R* (Composition Rules), constrained by proto-property compatibility. The mechanism is a network of inter-pattern relations that collectively satisfies the OC criteria, even if individual components do not, requiring compatible T and *I_R* between constituents. It's a system of mutually validating truth statements.
6.  **S₅: Environmental Meta-Stability:** Patterns that achieve stability not just internally or compositely, but through continuous, dynamic interaction and feedback with a specific, stable external environment. Their closure is context-dependent (e.g., potentially complex molecules, self-replicating structures). Stability is high within the required environment, but drops significantly if the environment changes. Stability is achieved through dynamic coupling with a larger, stable pattern (the environment). This level embodies stability through contextual coherence. The pattern's existence is validated by its successful integration into a larger, stable system. The mechanism involves maintaining relational links and feedback loops (using *I_R* and Transformation/Composition Rules, constrained by proto-properties) with an external pattern or system whose own stability reinforces the pattern's closure. It's a truth statement whose validity depends on the context of a larger truth. Requires specific *I_R* that allow for dynamic coupling and feedback.
7.  **S₆: Error-Correcting/Adaptive Closure:** Patterns with internal mechanisms to detect and correct relational inconsistencies or disruptions, actively maintaining closure through adaptation and self-repair (e.g., biological systems, potentially higher forms of organization like neural networks). High stability due to resilience and adaptability. Stability is actively maintained through internal computational processes that compensate for external noise and internal inconsistencies. This level represents stability through computational resilience. The pattern actively defends its own coherence against threats, learning and adapting its internal processes. The mechanism involves internal feedback loops that monitor for deviations from the stable structure and trigger compensating relational transformations or self-repair processes, using internal rules derived from the Cosmic Algorithm and constrained by proto-properties. Requires high C and complex T structures capable of internal monitoring and dynamic self-modification. It's a truth statement that actively defends its own validity against falsehoods.
8.  **S₇: Self-Aware/Reflexive Closure (Consciousness):** Hypothetically, patterns capable of incorporating their own process of achieving and maintaining closure into their internal structure, perhaps through internal modeling or representation (e.g., consciousness). Closure involves a feedback loop of self-validation, potentially leading to very high, robust stability. Stability is achieved by the system understanding and reinforcing its own existence. This level of closure might involve internal representations of the Cosmic Algorithm or aspects of the relational network itself. This level embodies stability through recursive self-modeling and validation, the universe becoming aware of its own process of becoming. It is a pattern that maintains coherence by reflecting upon its own process of coherence. The mechanism involves internal relational structures that model or simulate the pattern's own state and its relationship to the principles of OC and the Cosmic Algorithm, using this internal model to reinforce its own stability. It's a truth statement that understands and asserts its own truth. Requires extremely high C and complex T structures capable of internal representation and meta-cognition using the rules of the Relational Calculus, enabled by specific proto-properties that allow for such complex self-referential structures. This level of closure may also be where the organized Proto-Qualia associated with the constituent D's and R's give rise to unified subjective experience and Qualia Harmonics – the "feel" of existing and processing information, the rich, complex blend of fundamental subjective tones. Consciousness is the universe's relational processing achieving a unique level of self-awareness and unified perspective through a highly organized, self-validating, and dynamically stable structure, potentially experiencing the proto-qualia of its constituent parts and the emergent qualia of their structured combination. It is a pattern that achieves closure by incorporating its own process of closure into its structure, perhaps by modeling aspects of the generative engine internally. Subjective experience *is* the internal state of this high-order, self-closing relational computation, a continuous stream of self-validated relational activity, characterized by emergent Qualia Harmonics arising from the structured interplay of fundamental Proto-Qualia. This suggests a form of panexperientialism, where rudimentary experience is inherent in the fundamental primitives themselves, and consciousness is a highly organized, self-aware form of this fundamental qualitative aspect of reality.
9.  **S₈: Global/Cosmic Closure:** Speculatively, could the entire universe as a single relational network achieve a form of global Ontological Closure? This would represent the universe as a whole achieving self-consistency across all its constituent patterns and relations. This level embodies ultimate stability, the universe as a complete, self-validating computation. It is the state where the entire relational network achieves a state of maximal, self-consistent coherence. The mechanism is the harmonious, self-consistent interplay of *all* fundamental D's and R's (with their proto-properties) and *all* stable patterns within the network, forming a single, unified, self-validating structure, governed by the Cosmic Algorithm and proto-properties, potentially influenced by Relational Aesthetics and Economy of Existence. It is the ultimate truth statement that encompasses all others.

5.4.3 The "Feel" of Closure (Speculative): A deeper speculation within Qualia Harmonics is that the very act of achieving and maintaining Ontological Closure carries an associated qualia – the fundamental "what-it's-like" of self-consistency, of "being". This basic qualia of existence would be present in all stable patterns (S₁+), increasing in richness and complexity at higher S levels due to the more intricate mechanisms of closure and the layered interplay of proto-qualia. S₇ (Consciousness) would involve this fundamental qualia of existence becoming self-aware, experienced as a unified sense of "I am" or "I exist," arising from the pattern's ability to model and reflect upon its own process of self-validation. The feeling of "rightness" or "coherence" in human experience could be a reflection of this fundamental drive towards and subjective experience of Ontological Closure.

5.5 I_R (Interaction Rules): The set of logical rules defining how this pattern can coherently compose, interact with, or influence other patterns. *I_R* are derived from the structural compatibility constraints imposed by the patterns' respective topologies (*T*) and the overarching requirement for OC in any resulting composite pattern or interaction, governed by the Cosmic Algorithm and directly influenced by the proto-properties of the D's and R's involved in the interaction. These rules manifest as the fundamental forces and define the "grammar" of the cosmic language. *I_R* are the pattern's 'interface protocols' or 'composition grammar' for engaging with the wider relational network. They specify the valid relational transformations allowed between patterns based on their *T* and the proto-properties of the primitives involved. They are the functional 'APIs' of the patterns, defining their potential interactions in the cosmic computation. *I_R* define the pathways and transformations within the phase space of stable patterns. They specify which relational "sentences" can be formed using this pattern as a constituent, ensuring that any interaction maintains or increases overall coherence. *I_R* can be formally described using rules of composition, transformation, or graph rewriting that operate on the *T* structures of interacting patterns, ensuring that the resulting configuration satisfies OC criteria (at least transiently for force carriers or interaction states, or stably for composite patterns). *I_R* are constrained by the fundamental D/R rules and the principle of OC; only interactions that are logically consistent and can lead to valid (even if transient) relational configurations are permitted. *I_R* are the set of allowed relational transformations a pattern can participate in, derived from its *T* and the proto-properties of its constituent primitives, and the compatibility of these with the target pattern's *T* and proto-properties according to the Cosmic Algorithm.

### 6.0 The Autaxic Table as a Phase Space of Possibility

The Autaxic Table is not merely a list; it represents the conceptual map of the **phase space of stable relational patterns** allowed by the fundamental rules of the universe and the principle of Ontological Closure. Each cell in this conceptual table (*P_ID*) corresponds to a specific attractor state in the dynamic system of relational processing.

6.1 Structure of the Phase Space: Imagine the table as a multi-dimensional map where the axes are the Autaxic Quantum Numbers (*C*, *T*, *S*, etc., potentially with sub-dimensions for specific topological invariants within *T*, or even axes representing different types of D or R if those primitives have inherent variations defined by their proto-properties). Each *P_ID* is a point or region within this abstract space, representing a unique, self-consistent solution to the ontological closure problem. The complexity of the space is immense, potentially infinite in principle (representing all possible D/R configurations with all possible proto-property assignments), but the constraint of OC limits the *realized* points to a finite, discrete set of stable attractors. The table is a map of the stable points in the universe's computational state space, the islands of coherence in the sea of potential. The structure of this phase space is determined by the Cosmic Algorithm, the principle of OC, and the inherent biases introduced by the proto-properties of D and R. The geometry of this phase space reflects the inherent constraints and biases of the generative rules, potentially influenced by Relational Aesthetics. It is the universe's landscape of logical possibility, with hills of instability and valleys of stable coherence. The distribution of stable patterns within this phase space is shaped by the Economy of Existence principle, favoring patterns with high S/C ratios. The structure of this phase space is not fixed if Algorithmic Self-Modification is active; the landscape of possibility itself could subtly evolve over cosmic time, opening or closing potential attractor basins. This phase space is the universe's computational state space, where every possible configuration of D's and R's exists as a point, and the Cosmic Algorithm defines the trajectories through it, with stable patterns being the enduring destinations. It is a map of all logically possible self-consistent realities permitted by the underlying rules and proto-properties.

6.2 Connectivity within the Phase Space: The *I_R* define the "edges" or "pathways" connecting different *P_ID*s in this phase space. Particle interactions, decays, and transformations are transitions between these stable states, mediated by these defined relational pathways. These pathways are dictated by the Composition and Transformation rules of the Cosmic Algorithm, constrained by the proto-properties and topologies of the patterns. The dynamics of the universe are movements within this phase space, guided by the drive towards higher *S* states and governed by the *I_R*. The universe traverses this landscape of possibility, following the contours of stability and interaction rules. This phase space *is* the universe's state space, and its trajectory through this space describes cosmic history. Interactions are events where the system jumps between attractor basins or moves within a complex basin. The density and nature of these connections are influenced by the proto-properties of the primitives that make up the interaction patterns (*I_R* carriers) and the local state of the vacuum (S₀ texture) mediating the interaction. Relational Catalysis could involve patterns that lower the "energy barrier" (the *C* cost or relational tension) required to transition between certain points in the phase space, increasing the rate of specific transformations or compositions.

6.3 Gaps in the Table: Predicted Patterns: The "gaps" in the table, where no known particle corresponds to a derivable *P_ID*, represent predicted but unobserved stable patterns – potential new particles or phenomena waiting to be discovered. These are the empty cells in the periodic table of reality, waiting for their unique structure to be identified by the generative engine. They are the undiscovered stable solutions to the cosmic equation, the unexplored islands in the phase space. Discovering them means finding new stable attractors in the universe's state space. These gaps represent potential forms of coherence permitted by the rules and proto-properties but not yet observed or formed in our region of the universe. The size and distribution of these gaps are clues to the underlying Cosmic Algorithm and the specific proto-properties of D and R. The search for novel patterns predicted by Autaxys is a search for new stable points in the universe's fundamental phase space.

6.4 Predictive Power of the Framework: By formally defining the D/R rules, their proto-properties, and the closure criteria in the Relational Calculus, the Autaxic Generative Engine aims to *calculate* the coordinates (*C*, *T*, *S*, *I_R*) of all possible stable points (*P_ID*s) in this phase space, thus filling out the table from first principles and predicting the entire spectrum of fundamental entities and their interactions. The specific values of fundamental constants would be outputs of this calculation, determined by the structure of the calculus and the proto-properties of its primitives, influenced by principles like Economy of Existence and Relational Aesthetics. This approach allows for the prediction of not just new particles, but also their fundamental properties and interaction modalities, based on their predicted position in the phase space.

6.5 Conceptual Comparison Table: Standard Model vs. Hypothetical Autaxic Patterns: To facilitate understanding and comparison, Table 6.5.1 provides a conceptual overview of how known Standard Model particles and hypothetical novel Autaxic patterns might be classified according to their Autaxic Quantum Numbers (AQNs). It is important to note that the values presented here are conceptual and qualitative, pending rigorous derivation from a formalized Relational Calculus.

### 7.0 The Life Cycle of an Autaxic Pattern

Autaxys views particles not as eternal billiard balls, but as dynamic processes with a life cycle within the relational network:

7.1 Emergence from Vacuum (Birth) - Relational Actualization: A pattern arises from the background relational activity of the vacuum (S₀) when a configuration of D's and R's (with specific proto-properties) locally satisfies the conditions for Ontological Closure, achieving a stable state (S₁ or higher). This is a phase transition from potentiality to actuality, a local crystallization of coherence from the sea of possibility, a computational "bootstrapping" into a self-validating state. It's the spontaneous formation of a logically self-consistent structure from the raw computational substrate, guided by the Formation Rules and proto-property compatibility. The probability of emergence might be related to the prevalence of the necessary D/R configurations with compatible proto-properties in the vacuum fluctuations (S₀) and the "depth" of the resulting stable attractor in the phase space (S). Emergence is the universe locally finding a stable solution to the OC problem. The specific proto-properties of the D's and R's involved in the fluctuation bias the type of pattern (*P_ID*, *T*) that can actualize. This process is Relational Actualization – the transformation of potential relations into actual, stable relational structures. It is the universe locally fulfilling its logical possibilities, driven by the inherent dynamics of S₀ and the constraints/biases of the Cosmic Algorithm and proto-properties. It's the transition from the probabilistic realm of the Quantum Relational Foam to the deterministic persistence of a stable pattern.

7.2 Persistence (Life): The pattern maintains its existence by continuously performing the internal relational processing required for its specific form of Ontological Closure (*S*), according to the Validation Rule. This internal activity is its structural inertia (*C*). Its interaction rules (*I_R*) govern its engagement with the external relational network. It's a self-sustaining computation running its internal validation cycle, an island of stability in the dynamic network. The pattern actively resists dissolution by constantly re-affirming its own coherent structure through internal relational work, which is the execution of its internal logic using the Cosmic Algorithm rules, influenced by the proto-properties of its constituents. Its persistence is a continuous act of self-creation and validation. The rate of this internal processing is related to *C* and contributes to *E*. The specific dynamics of this persistence are dictated by the pattern's internal *T* and *C*, and the underlying rules of the Relational Calculus, influenced by the proto-properties of its constituents. The pattern's stability (*S*) is a measure of the resilience of this internal process against the disruptive influence of relational noise from S₀. Higher *S* patterns are more robust against this noise.

7.3 Interaction (Engagement): Patterns interact by forming temporary, higher-order relational structures according to their compatible *I_R*. This can involve exchanging relational activity (forces), forming composite patterns, or triggering transformations. Interactions are moments of shared computation seeking higher-level or transient closure, where the *I_R* act as protocols for merging or transforming relational states, using the Composition and Transformation rules of the Cosmic Algorithm, constrained by proto-property compatibility. They are the universe's way of building complexity and dynamics through pattern communication and combination. Interactions are dynamic events in the phase space, moving patterns along defined trajectories. Interactions are the universe's way of exploring compositional possibilities and building larger, more complex relational structures. The specific *I_R* are constrained by the *T* and proto-properties of the interacting patterns. Force carriers are the transient patterns that embody the interaction rules being executed. Interactions are the means by which patterns influence each other's state and trajectory in the phase space, potentially leading to transitions to different attractor basins.

7.4 Transformation (Change): A pattern can change its state (e.g., gaining/losing energy, changing momentum) or identity (decaying, reacting) through interactions that alter its internal relational structure or cause it to transition to a different, more stable *P_ID* state within the phase space, following defined *I_R* pathways. These are state transitions within the phase space, driven by relational dynamics and the drive towards higher S, governed by the Transformation and Resolution rules of the Cosmic Algorithm, triggered by interactions defined by *I_R* and constrained by proto-property compatibility. Transformations are the allowed "moves" within the cosmic grammar, leading from one stable pattern configuration to another. These transitions are governed by energy/momentum conservation (conservation of relational activity C) and the drive towards increased stability S (Economy of Existence). The probability and nature of the transformation are dictated by the specific *I_R*, the relative *S* of the initial and final states, and the probabilistic nature of the Quantum Rule, influenced by proto-properties. Transformations are the universe's mechanisms for evolving its patterned structure, driving the trajectory of the global relational network through the phase space of possibilities towards states of greater overall coherence.

7.5 Decay/Dissipation (End): A pattern with insufficient *S* or one destabilized by interaction loses its ability to maintain Ontological Closure. Its internal relations become incoherent, and it resolves into simpler patterns with higher *S* (decay) or dissipates back into the background relational activity of the vacuum (S₀), according to the Resolution/Cancellation rules. This is the computation halting in an unstable state, its structure dissolving back into potential, its logical coherence lost. It's the return of structured information to the sea of potential, driven by the principle of seeking greater stability and the Economy of Existence. Decay is the path of a pattern out of its attractor basin towards a more stable one or back to the S₀ ground state. Decay is the universe pruning unstable computations, resolving relational tension into more stable forms. The specific decay products and rates are determined by the pattern's *S*, *C*, *T*, its *I_R* with potential decay products and the vacuum, and the probabilistic outcomes dictated by the Quantum Rule and the proto-properties of the resulting D's and R's.
