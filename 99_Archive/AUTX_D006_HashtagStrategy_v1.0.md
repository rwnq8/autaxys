# Hashtag Strategy for Autaxys/Autology Content Promotion

**Objective:** To maximize visibility and engagement for content related to autaxys, autology, and the foundational document D002 ("Autaxys and Autology: Definition, Rationale, and Implications") on relevant social media platforms (LinkedIn Posts, Mastodon Science Channels).

**Core Principles:**
*   **Relevance:** Hashtags must be directly related to the core concepts or the broader fields of discussion.
*   **Discoverability:** Prioritize hashtags that are actively followed and searched for by the target audience (academics, researchers, intellectuals interested in foundational questions).
*   **Meaningfulness:** Avoid overly generic or obscure hashtags. Each should add clear contextual value.
*   **Platform Appropriateness:** While many hashtags are cross-platform, consider nuances if any.
*   **Conciseness:** Aim for a focused set of high-impact hashtags per post rather than an exhaustive list.

**Primary Branded Hashtag:**
*   **#QNFO** (To be used in all posts to build brand/initiative recognition)

**Core Concept Hashtags:**
*   **#Autaxys** (The central new principle)
*   **#Autology** (The new field of study)
*   **#PatternBasedReality** (A key descriptive phrase for the framework)

**Broader Field / Domain Hashtags:**
*   **#FoundationalPhysics** (Targets audience interested in the fundamental nature of physics)
*   **#PhilosophyOfScience** (Targets audience interested in epistemological and metaphysical aspects of science)
*   **#Ontology** (Directly relates to the nature of being, a core theme)
*   **#Epistemology** (Relates to the theory of knowledge, also a core theme)
*   **#TheoreticalPhysics** (Broader than foundational, but relevant)
*   **#ComplexityScience** (Connects to emergence and self-organization aspects)
*   **#SystemsTheory** (Relevant to autaxys as a self-ordering system)

**Methodology & Approach Hashtags:**
*   **#NewScience** (Signals a novel approach or paradigm shift)
*   **#InterdisciplinaryResearch** (Highlights the nature of autology)
*   **#FirstPrinciples** (If discussing the derivation method)

**Audience / Engagement Hashtags:**
*   **#Academia** (General academic audience)
*   **#Research** (General research audience)
*   **#ScienceCommunication** (If the post aims for broader outreach)
*   **#BigQuestions** (Appeals to those interested in fundamental inquiries)
*   **#Innovation** (If highlighting novel aspects)

**Specific Anomaly/Topic Hashtags (Use as relevant to post content):**
*   **#Infoton** or **#i1Pattern** (When specifically discussing the î₁ pattern)
*   **#StandardModel** (When critiquing or comparing)
*   **#QuantumMechanics** (When discussing reinterpretations)
*   **#Cosmology** (When discussing implications for the universe)

**Recommended Usage Strategy:**

*   **For each post (LinkedIn Post, Mastodon):**
    *   Always include **#QNFO**.
    *   Include **#Autaxys** and **#Autology**.
    *   Select 2-4 additional hashtags from "Broader Field/Domain" that best fit the post's specific angle.
    *   Consider 1-2 from "Methodology & Approach" or "Audience/Engagement" if appropriate.
    *   If the post focuses on a specific topic like î₁, include the relevant "Specific Anomaly/Topic Hashtag."
*   **Total Hashtags:** Aim for approximately 5-8 highly relevant hashtags per post for LinkedIn. Mastodon can sometimes accommodate more, but relevance is key.
*   **Research/Validation:** While these are proposed based on relevance, ongoing monitoring of which hashtags generate engagement or are used by the target community would be beneficial for refining this strategy over time. (This is outside the AI's current capability but a recommendation for human oversight).

This strategy provides a balanced mix of core conceptual tags, broader domain tags, and engagement-focused tags to enhance discoverability and contextualize the research.
