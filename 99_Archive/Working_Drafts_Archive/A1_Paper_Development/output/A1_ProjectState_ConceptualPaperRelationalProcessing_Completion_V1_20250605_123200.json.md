This involved outlining the paper structure, drafting content for each section based on the Autaxys Master Plan and AFKB insights, discussing candidate formalisms (Graph Theory, Category Theory, Process Algebra, CSPs, Formal Logic, etc.) for Dynamic I and Meta-Logic I, and outlining methodological considerations. The process included iterative refinement and QA.",
