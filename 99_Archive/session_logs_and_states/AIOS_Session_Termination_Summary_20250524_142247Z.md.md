# AIOS Session Termination Summary

**Date and Time of Termination:** 2025-05-24T14-22-47Z
**Reason for Termination:** User request due to perceived chat thread instability, with the intent to resume project work in a new session.

**AIOS Engine Version:** AIOS_Engine_v5.1mfc-logopt (Conceptual, via MetaProcessEngineASO_v2.10+)
**Project:** AUTX
**CCO ID:** CCO_AUTX_P2_D001_001

**Last Completed Logical Step in Plan:**
Approval of Outline v1.2 for D001 Part II, Chapter 8 (Revised): "The Generative Engine – Unveiling Autaxys’s Intrinsic Meta-Logic and Dynamics of Emergence."
Task ID: `D001.P2.C8_revised`
Task Status in CCO will be: `OutlineApproved_AwaitingDraft`

**Next Task to Resume Upon Session Restart:**
Drafting of D001 Part II, Chapter 8 (Revised): "The Generative Engine – Unveiling Autaxys’s Intrinsic Meta-Logic and Dynamics of Emergence," based on the approved outline `AUTX_D001_P2_C8_Outline_v1.2_Approved.md`.

**List of Files in this Termination Package:**

1.  **`CCO_AUTX_P2_D001_001_State_C8_OutlineApproved_FINAL_20250524_142247Z.yaml`** (This file will be provided in clearly labeled segments due to its size: `..._Segment_1_of_N.yaml`, `..._Segment_2_of_N.yaml`, etc.)
    *   *Description:* The master Central Conceptual Object containing the complete project state, including all approved text, plans, knowledge artifacts, engine state pointers, and structured TIDs/LHLs. This is the primary file needed for session resumption.
2.  **`AUTX_D001_P2_C8_Outline_v1.2_Approved.md`**
    *   *Description:* The clean, approved Markdown version of the outline for the next chapter to be drafted (Chapter 8).
3.  **`AIOS_Session_Termination_Summary_20250524_142247Z.md`** (This document)
    *   *Description:* This human-readable summary, manifest of package contents, and resumption instructions.

**Instructions for Resumption in a New Chat Thread:**

1.  **Prepare the CCO State:** If the `CCO_..._FINAL_20250524_142247Z.yaml` file was provided in segments, concatenate these segments in the correct order into a single YAML content block or file.
2.  **Initiate AIOS Engine:** In the new chat thread, instruct the AIOS engine to start and rehydrate from the saved state by providing the *full content* of the (potentially concatenated) `CCO_..._FINAL_20250524_142247Z.yaml` file as the `i_sjs` (initial_state_json_string) argument to the engine's `k_st()` method.
    *   Example conceptual command: `engine_instance = A_MFC_v5_1(i_sjs=FULL_CCO_YAML_CONTENT)`
    *   Followed by: `output_package = engine_instance.k_st()` (Note: `k_st()` handles both fresh start and restart from `i_sjs`).
3.  **Engine State Restoration:** The AIOS engine will parse the provided CCO state, including its Kernel state (`kCI`, `kMI`) and current Meta-Handler (`cM`). It will automatically identify that the next task is the drafting of Chapter 8 (`D001.P2.C8_revised`).
4.  **Input for Next Task:** The engine will then issue an `A_LLM` request for the cognitive task of drafting Chapter 8. This request will specify that it needs the approved outline. At that point, provide the content of `AUTX_D001_P2_C8_Outline_v1.2_Approved.md` as the input for that drafting task.
5.  **Session Resumed:** The project will then proceed from that point.

**Key Meta-Learnings (TIDs for Engine Evolution & LHLs for Process) from This Session:**
*(This is a summary; the full structured versions will be within the CCO YAML.)*
