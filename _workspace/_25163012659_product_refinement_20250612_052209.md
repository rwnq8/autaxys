Formalizing Autaxys requires borrowing and adapting powerful ideas from several fields of mathematics and computer science.

Below is a proposed mathematical framework, serving as a toolkit for constructing the formal system referred to as the Relational Calculus. This framework is speculative but aims to ground abstract Autaxys concepts in specific formalisms, making them testable in principle.

The core idea is to describe the universe as an **attributed, dynamic graph**, whose structure and potential transformations are defined by intrinsic **proto-properties**, and whose evolution is governed by an **optimization principle** derived from the framework's own axioms.

### Level 1: Formalizing the Static Structure (The Attributed Relational Graph)

The state of the universe at any instant is described using **Graph Theory**, specifically as an Attributed Relational Graph `G = (D, R, f_D, f_R)`:

*   **`D`** is the set of vertices (the **Distinctions**), representing fundamental entities or points of differentiation.
*   **`R`** is the set of edges (the **Relations**), representing connections or relationships between Distinctions.
*   **`f_D: D → P(Π_D)`** is a function assigning a *set* of **Proto-properties** from space `Π_D` to each Distinction. `Π_D` contains fundamental types, qualities, or attribute values (e.g., discrete labels, elements of algebraic structures, continuous values) that define the nature and potential interactions of Distinctions.
*   **`f_R: R → P(Π_R)`** is a function assigning a *set* of Proto-properties from space `Π_R` to each Relation. `Π_R` contains fundamental relation attributes (nature, type, strength, directionality) that define the nature and potential transformations of Relations.

These proto-properties assigned via `f_D` and `f_R` are intrinsic to the graph state `G` and are fundamental. They are not passive labels but define the inherent capabilities and constraints of the graph elements, dictating which interactions (Level 3 rewrite rules) are possible and their outcomes, and intrinsically defining the preconditions and postconditions of the rules.

Persistent, stable attributed subgraph configurations within `G` are identified as `P_ID`s. These are candidates for fundamental "particles" or persistent structures, characterized by their emergent properties (AQNs).

### Level 2: Formalizing the Autaxic Quantum Numbers (AQNs)

Key properties of a `P_ID`'s attributed subgraph, `G_P_ID`, are derived as computable quantities. These are the emergent Autaxic Quantum Numbers: Complexity (`C`), Topology (`T`), and Stability (`S`). They are evaluated for identified `P_ID` patterns based on their Level 1 structure and proto-properties. Their computation, particularly for Stability, is intrinsically linked to the potential transformations defined by the Level 3 Graph Rewriting System.

#### 1. Complexity (`C`) → Mass: Algorithmic Information Theory

"Computational busyness" or "structural inertia" is formalized using **Kolmogorov Complexity**.

> **`C(P_ID) ≈ K(G_P_ID)`**

`K(G_P_ID)` is the length of the shortest computer program (for a fixed universal computer) that fully describes the attributed subgraph `G_P_ID` (vertices, edges, and their assigned proto-properties). Simple patterns have low `K` (low complexity/mass); complex patterns have high `K` (high complexity/mass). The `≈` acknowledges that `K` is theoretically uncomputable; practical implementations within this framework would likely rely on approximations or relative measures based on the complexity of describing the pattern using the system's own rewrite rules (Level 3), which represent the system's intrinsic descriptive language.
*   **Implication:** Mass is a measure of irreducible information content or minimal structural description length within the system's own descriptive grammar.

#### 2. Topology (`T`) → Charge/Spin: Group Theory & Graph Invariants

`T` describes the symmetry and intrinsic structure of the pattern, respecting proto-property assignments.

> **`T(P_ID) = { Aut(G_P_ID), χ(G_P_ID), β(G_P_ID), ... }`**

*   **`Aut(G_P_ID)`** is the **automorphism group** of `G_P_ID` that preserves both its structure *and* its proto-property assignments. This group captures the symmetries of the attributed pattern. Its structure and representations are hypothesized to define the pattern's 'charges' and fundamental interactions, analogous to gauge groups (`U(1)`, `SU(2)`, `SU(3)`).
*   **`χ(G_P_ID)`** (Chromatic Number), **`β(G_P_ID)`** (Betti numbers), or other **graph invariants** (spectrum, connectivity measures) describe other topological/structural properties. These invariants must also respect proto-property assignments and could map to quantum numbers like spin, parity, etc.

#### 3. Stability (`S`) → Lifetime: Dynamical Systems & Attractor Basins

`S` measures a pattern's resilience to dynamic transformations. It's formalized using **dynamical systems** concepts and **attractor basins** within the state space of attributed graph configurations, defined by the Graph Rewriting System (Level 3).

> **`S(P_ID) ∝ -ΔE_OC`**

A stable `P_ID` with **Ontological Closure (OC)** represents an attractor state in the graph state space reachable via rewrite rules. Its stability relates to the basin's "depth," determined by the rewrite rules (Level 3) and proto-properties (Level 1) that define the transformation landscape.
*   **`ΔE_OC`** is the "escape energy" or minimum "Relational Tension" required by the rules to transform the pattern out of its stable configuration, breaking OC. This "cost" is measured by the minimum action/complexity of rule applications needed, *constrained by the proto-properties* of the pattern's elements and the rules' preconditions.
*   High `S` means a deep basin (stable, long lifetime); low `S` means a shallow basin (unstable, short lifetime).

### Level 3: Formalizing the Dynamics (The Graph Rewriting System)

The universe's Attributed Relational Graph `G` evolves via the **Graph Rewriting System**, the **Cosmic Algorithm**. This system defines the *possible* transformations of the graph state. It operates on the graph structure and attributes (Level 1), is strictly constrained by proto-properties (Level 1), and rule *selection* is guided by the optimization principle (Level 4), which evaluates states based on emergent properties (AQNs, Level 2).

The system is a set of production rules `{r_i}`:

> **`r_i : L_i → R_i`**

`L_i` is a "left-hand side" attributed subgraph pattern, **including specific proto-property requirements**. If a subgraph isomorphic to `L_i` (matching structure *and* proto-properties) is found in `G_t`, it represents a *potential* transformation. Applying the rule replaces the matched subgraph with `R_i` (defining resulting structure *and* proto-properties). These rules embody core postulates, where proto-properties act as explicit preconditions for rule applicability and determine the structure and properties of `R_i`. This rule set defines the discrete set of possible transitions from any given state, shaping the state space "landscape" navigated by the Level 4 principle.

### Level 4: The Grand Unifying Equation (The Autaxic Action Principle)

Why are specific rewrite rules applied? What guides the evolution? We need an "action principle," analogous to the Principle of Least Action in classical physics. But here, the system seeks to maximize a quantity representing coherence and elegance.

We define the **Autaxic Lagrangian (`L_A`)** as a computable functional `L_A: G → ℝ` that quantifies the instantaneous 'existential fitness' or **Relational Aesthetics** of the state `G`. The **Stability-to-Complexity Ratio (S/C)** of identified `P_ID` patterns within `G` is the primary candidate component for `L_A`, reflecting the principle of Economy of Existence. `L_A` may also incorporate other global graph metrics reflecting overall structural coherence and efficiency. Determining the precise mathematical form of `L_A(G)` is a central challenge.

The framework hypothesizes that the universe's evolution follows paths that maximize this accumulated 'Relational Aesthetics' over time. For the discrete system evolving through states `G_0, G_1, G_2, ...`, the fundamental **Autaxic Action Principle** is to maximize the total Autaxic Action for an evolutionary path:

> **Maximize A_A = Σ L_A(G_t)** over an evolutionary path `G_0, G_1, ..., G_N`

This is the central principle. It's a variational principle stating that out of all possible sequences of graph rewrites, the universe realizes the one that maximizes the sum of instantaneous 'fitness' scores (`L_A`) of the states visited.

### Synthesis: The Computational Loop

The complete formalism describes an iterative computational loop driving evolution. This loop is a proposed *mechanism* for implementing the Level 4 principle of maximizing accumulated `A_A`. It operates as follows:

1.  **Given:** State `G_t` as an Attributed Relational Graph at time `t`. (Level 1)
2.  **Identify Potential Transitions:** Find all possible applications of Level 3 rewrite rules in `G_t`. This involves matching `L_i` patterns, including proto-property constraints (Level 3 operating on Level 1).
3.  **Generate Potential Next States:** For each identified potential transition, generate the resulting potential next state `G_{t+1}^{(j)}` by applying the rule (Level 3).
4.  **Evaluate Potential States:** For each potential next state `G_{t+1}^{(j)}`, calculate its Autaxic Lagrangian `L_A(G_{t+1}^{(j)})`. This quantifies the 'Relational Aesthetics' or "fitness" of the potential state (Level 4 evaluation).
5.  **Select Actual State (Local Optimization Mechanism):** The universe's evolution proceeds to the state `G_{t+1}^{(k)}` that **maximized `L_A(G_{t+1}^{(j)})`** among all potential next states. This step represents the system's proposed local optimization mechanism: it selects the immediate transition yielding the 'fittest' next state, as quantified by `L_A`. This greedy local selection strategy is hypothesized to be the mechanism by which the system navigates the state space, implementing the global principle of maximizing accumulated `A_A` over time by always taking the locally 'best' step.
6.  **Actualize:** The selected `G_{t+1}^{(k)}` becomes `G_{t+1}`. Repeat.

This framework transforms physics into a **generative science** deriving reality from maximizing existential coherence. The central challenge lies in discovering the precise mathematical nature of proto-properties (`Π_D`, `Π_R`), the specific rewrite rules (Cosmic Algorithm), and the computable definition of `L_A(G)`, such that the emergent `P_ID`s, AQNs, and dynamics match observed physical reality.
