*   Task 2.6: Summarize CEE Key Findings (Automated - `AI_SKILL: SummarizeProject`)
    *   Summarize CEE focus, GA exploration, and connection to autaxys.
*   Task 2.7: Summarize FCE Key Findings (Automated - `AI_SKILL: SummarizeProject`)
    *   Summarize FCE focus, explorations, and connection to autaxys.
*   Task 2.8: Summarize PBRF Key Findings (Automated - `AI_SKILL: SummarizeProject`)
    *   Summarize PBRF key aspects, pattern-based table concept, and influence on autaxys.
*   Task 2.9: Generate Project Timeline Table (Automated - `AI_SKILL: GenerateTimeline`)
    *   Generate a text-based timeline table with approximate dates/durations for each project based on file metadata.  *(User to review/confirm)*
*   Task 2.10: Synthesize "Infoton" and "Pattern Table" Concepts (Automated - `AI_SKILL: SynthesizeConcepts`)
    *   Create dedicated summary of "infoton" and PBRF "pattern-based table," highlighting their connection to autaxys.

**Phase 3: Propose Research Avenues & Methodological Considerations**

*   Task 3.1: Generate Research Questions for Autaxys (Manual Research - `AI_SKILL: GenerateResearchQuestions`)
    *   Based on findings in Phase 2, generate research questions addressing unresolved issues and novel predictions within autaxys.
*   Task 3.2: Analyze Methodological Lessons (Manual Research - `AI_SKILL: AnalyzeMethodology`)
    *   Analyze past project failures (Infomatics, IO, LCRF) to identify methodological pitfalls and best practices for autaxys research.

**Phase 4: Explore Open Questions & Future Directions**

*   Task 4.1: Synthesize Open Questions from Prior Research (Manual Research - `AI_SKILL: SynthesizeOpenQuestions`)
    *   Consolidate open questions from previous projects' "Parking Lot" files and other relevant sources, linking them to potential autaxys research.
*   Task 4.2: Outline Future Research Directions (Manual Research - `AI_SKILL: OutlineFutureDirections`)
    *   Outline future research directions for autaxys/autology, incorporating open questions and speculative ideas.

**Phase 5: Compile and Review Report**

*   Task 5.1: Compile Report Draft (Automated - `AI_SKILL: CompileReport`)
    *   Assemble all generated content into a coherent report draft.
*   Task 5.2: User Review and Feedback (Manual Review)
    *   User reviews report draft, provides feedback, and requests revisions/clarifications.

**Task Sequencing:** Phases and tasks proceed sequentially. Tasks within a phase can potentially be parallelized if dependencies allow.

**Resource Requirements:** Access to all source material `.md` files. Computational resources for automated tasks (knowledge graph generation, concept extraction, summarization).

**Quality Assurance:** All automated tasks will include internal QA checks (e.g., consistency, completeness). User review (Task 5.2) provides final quality control.
