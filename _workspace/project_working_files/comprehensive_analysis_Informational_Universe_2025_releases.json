Observable phenomena are stable resonant patterns. The *Infomatics Operational Framework* (v2.5) derives fundamental constants from π and φ and proposes solutions for cosmological anomalies. Initial Phase 3 exploration revealed a strong correlation between particle mass scales and φ, specifically linked to the primality of Lucas numbers ($L_m$). The core challenge remains deriving the fundamental stability criteria and dynamic equations from π-φ principles, which is the focus of ongoing Phase 3 work. The author emphasizes avoiding axiomatic assumptions without theoretical derivation.",

It views nature, including biological processes like photosynthesis and avian navigation, as a computational ecosystem.

Infomatics posits information as fundamental, defining reality through core variables like contrast (κ), resolution (ε), sequence (τ), repetition (ρ), and mimicry (m). A key part is the Π-φ Physics Reformulation, which replaces standard physical constants with expressions involving π and φ, based on a Continuum Postulate. This leads to modified fundamental equations (Schrödinger, Dirac, Maxwell, etc.) and proposes new natural units. The framework aims for universality, applying to quantum, classical, and cognitive systems, and suggests testable predictions, though it requires further mathematical development and empirical validation.",

The framework posits that reality originates from a continuous, fundamental information field governed by geometric principles (π and φ). It critiques standard physics paradigms (SM, GR, QM) for their reliance on discreteness and artificial constructs, proposing instead that fundamental constants and physical phenomena (including particle masses, gravity, and cosmology) can be derived purely from π and φ. The documents detail the framework's evolution, its operationalization through concepts like resolution (ε) and contrast (κ), empirical correlations (e.g., particle mass scaling with φ), and its positioning relative to other fundamental theories. While presenting a parsimonious alternative that addresses issues like dark matter/energy and the measurement problem, the lineage report highlights challenges, including the prediction of an unobserved particle (Î₁), which led to a re-evaluation of the approach.",
