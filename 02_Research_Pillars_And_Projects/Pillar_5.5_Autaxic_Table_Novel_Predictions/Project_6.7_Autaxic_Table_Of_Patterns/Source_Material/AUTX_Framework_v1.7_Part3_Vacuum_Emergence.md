### 8.0 The Autaxic Vacuum (S₀): The Ground State of Relational Potential

The "vacuum" is the ground state of the relational network – the minimal configuration of D's and R's existing even without stable patterns. It's the domain of potential relations and transient fluctuations, the sea of unresolved processing.

8.1 **Nature of S₀: The Quantum Relational Foam:** S₀ is a vast, interconnected, and rapidly fluctuating graph of D's and R's (with their proto-properties). It is a state of maximal potential relational activity and minimal persistent structure. Think of it as a seething sea of potential connections and differentiations, a continuous attempt by the Cosmic Algorithm to form relations that do not (yet) achieve stable Ontological Closure. It is the source of all transient fluctuations and virtual patterns. It embodies the universe's pure capacity for relationship and distinction before these crystallize into enduring forms. It is the state of maximal relational tension waiting to be resolved into stable coherence. The state of S₀ is defined by the fundamental D/R rules and their inherent dynamics, representing the lowest energy/complexity configuration that still maintains the potential for relation and distinction, influenced by the proto-properties of its constituents.

8.2 **The Texture of S₀:** At the Planck scale, this relational network has a specific microstructure or "texture" determined by the fundamental D/R rules and the proto-properties of D and R. This isn't smooth spacetime, but a dynamic, potentially discrete, and probabilistic graph. The properties of this texture (e.g., average connectivity density, types of transient R's that are momentarily favored based on proto-types, inherent biases in D/R formation/transformation due to proto-properties, the prevalence of specific minimal D/R configurations) directly influence the likelihood and nature of stable pattern emergence (S₁ from S₀) and interaction (*I_R*). The "grain" of the vacuum is the fundamental granularity of reality at its deepest level, the computational lattice upon which all emergent phenomena are built. This texture could be non-uniform, potentially exhibiting subtle large-scale biases or even topological defects from the early universe phase transition. The texture is a manifestation of the Cosmic Algorithm in its ground state, the dynamic fingerprint of the fundamental rules in action before stable patterns emerge. It is the arena where the probabilistic aspects of the Quantum Rule are most evident. The proto-properties of D and R are crucial in shaping this texture, biasing the types of connections and distinctions that are most likely to fleetingly form in the vacuum, giving S₀ its specific characteristics. It is the fundamental 'nothingness' from which 'somethingness' (distinctions and relations) emerges, and into which it dissolves. The texture of S₀ could be described as a densely connected, dynamically fluctuating graph with no large-scale persistent structures, but perhaps inherent biases in local connectivity or the types of relations (*R* with specific proto-types) that are momentarily favored by the rules and proto-properties. The dynamics of S₀ are a continuous, parallel computation exploring the vast space of possible D/R configurations permitted by the rules and proto-properties.

8.3 **Relational Noise:** The constant, unclosed flux of D's and R's in S₀ constitutes fundamental *relational noise*. This is the inherent background uncertainty and unpredictability in the relational network. This noise can perturb the internal dynamics of stable patterns, influencing their stability (*S*) and potentially triggering decay or forcing resolution from superposition. It's the fundamental 'static' in the cosmic computation, the inherent deviation from perfect coherence. The level and nature of this noise are determined by the dynamics of S₀, which are governed by the Cosmic Algorithm and the proto-properties of D and R. This noise is the source of spontaneous vacuum fluctuations and contributes to decoherence in quantum systems. It is the fundamental 'cost' of maintaining a dynamic potentiality – the inherent instability of the ground state before structured coherence emerges. The nature of this noise (e.g., its spectrum, correlation properties) is a key characteristic of the vacuum texture, influenced by proto-properties. Certain Relational Defects could be stable knots of this noise.

8.4 **Relational Tension:** The vacuum (S₀) can be seen as a state of high *potential* relational tension – a vast number of unfulfilled or inconsistent relational possibilities. The formation of stable patterns (*P_ID*) is a process of locally *resolving* this tension by achieving coherence. The drive towards higher *S* is the universe's tendency to minimize total relational tension by creating more stable, self-consistent structures. Unstable patterns represent unresolved tension that eventually forces them to decay. The universe seeks to reduce overall logical inconsistency by forming stable, coherent structures. This tension is the driving force behind the generative process, the universe's intrinsic motivation to find coherent solutions. It's the universe's fundamental 'discomfort' with incoherence. Relational Defects represent localized, stable regions of persistent relational tension within S₀. The drive towards minimal tension is a form of cosmic optimization, a principle of least action applied to logical consistency. This principle is potentially influenced by the proto-properties of D and R, as some combinations might inherently create more tension than others.

8.5 **Zero-Point Energy:** The minimal, irreducible relational activity inherent in S₀ is the Zero-Point Energy. It is the constant background processing load of the vacuum network, the energy required to maintain the potential for D's and R's and their dynamic interaction, influenced by the proto-properties. This energy fuels vacuum fluctuations and mediates interactions, acting as the baseline computational activity of the universe. It's the "cost" of potentiality, the restless energy of the logical ground state. This persistent activity could be related to dark energy, driving the large-scale dynamics of the emergent spacetime network by influencing the propagation rules (*c*) or the cost of relational action (*h*) across vast distances. It represents the 'noise' or 'background processing' of the cosmic computation, the base level of relational tension that hasn't been resolved into stable patterns. It's the fuel source for spontaneous pattern emergence and interaction mediation. The ZPE is the minimum relational activity required to maintain the computational substrate itself, the "cost of potentiality". It is the restless energy of pure possibility. The level of ZPE is likely determined by the specific D/R rules and the proto-properties of D and R, defining the minimum level of activity required to sustain the fundamental relational network itself.

8.6 **Virtual Patterns (Virtual Particles):** Transient configurations of D's and R's (with their proto-properties) that momentarily achieve minimal, unstable closure (*S* ≈ 0) within S₀. They represent fleeting computational attempts or localized coherences that quickly dissolve back into the background flux, according to the Resolution/Cancellation rules. They mediate *I_R* between stable patterns by providing temporary relational bridges or executing brief logical operations before dissipating. They are the ripples on the surface of the vacuum sea, the momentary crystallizations of potential relations that don't achieve lasting form but facilitate interaction between those that do. They embody the fleeting, probabilistic nature of the vacuum state. They are 'failed computations' or 'transient proofs of concept' in the vacuum's search for closure, mediating interactions without achieving lasting existence. They embody the fleeting, probabilistic nature of the vacuum state. They are the universe's way of exploring momentary relational connections that don't achieve lasting stability, but can still facilitate interaction between stable patterns. Their properties (e.g., virtual mass, lifetime) are governed by the rules of S₀ dynamics, the proto-properties of their constituents, and the specific *I_R* they are mediating.

8.7 **Relational Fields:** The Autaxys framework can reinterpret the concept of physical fields (like the electromagnetic field, gravitational field, Higgs field) as emergent properties of the relational network or collective behavior of patterns.

8.7.1 **Emergent Fields:** A Relational Field is not a fundamental entity but a description of the **collective state, biases, or potential for interaction within a region of the relational network**. This state is determined by the local density and types of D's and R's (with their proto-properties), the presence and properties (*T*, *C*, *S*) of stable patterns, and the influence of Relational Defects. A charged pattern creates a bias in the surrounding vacuum texture (S₀) via its *I_R* and the propagation rules, making it more likely for certain types of transient R's (with specific proto-types) to form or propagate in its vicinity – this is the electromagnetic field. A massive pattern deforms the network geometry, altering propagation rules – this is the gravitational field. The Higgs field is a description of the vacuum state's interaction potential with high-C patterns.

8.7.2 **Influence on D/R Dynamics:** Relational Fields influence the local application of the Cosmic Algorithm rules. The "strength" of a field at a point describes how strongly it biases the formation, transformation, or propagation of D's and R's (with specific proto-properties) at that location. For example, a strong electromagnetic field biases the Genesis and Formation rules for D's and R's with compatible proto-polarities/types, making certain configurations more likely to arise or persist transiently. A strong gravitational field biases the Propagation rules, altering the speed and direction of relational flow. Relational fields are the emergent forces or influences that guide the dynamics of the fundamental primitives and patterns within a region. They are the macroscopic manifestation of underlying biases in the relational network. They are not fundamental entities but descriptive tools for characterizing the state and potential of the relational substrate in a given region.

### 9.0 Relational Thermodynamics: Entropy, Temperature, and the Drive for Coherence

The concepts of thermodynamics are not just macroscopic descriptions but have roots in the fundamental dynamics of relational processing and the microstructure of the vacuum.

9.1 **Relational Entropy (S<sub>rel</sub>):** Reinterpreted as a measure of the degree of *unresolved relational tension* or *disorder* in the relational network. S₀ represents a state of high potential relational tension and maximal relational entropy (S<sub>rel max</sub>) because it contains a vast number of unclosed, fluctuating relations. The formation of stable patterns (S₁+), Relational Defects (S<sub>defect</sub>), and higher-order composite structures (S₄+) represents a local *decrease* in relational entropy, as potential tension is resolved into coherent, self-consistent configurations. The drive towards higher *S* levels is fundamentally a drive towards states of lower relational entropy and greater local order/coherence. Macroscopic entropy in classical thermodynamics is the cumulative effect of unresolved relational tension and disordered relational configurations at lower levels. It is the measure of the universe's computational "waste" or unresolved potential. The Second Law of Thermodynamics is the drive towards minimizing global relational tension, but the process of achieving local coherence (forming patterns) often dissipates some relational activity into unstructured S₀ fluctuations, increasing the overall S<sub>rel</sub> of the vacuum. It reflects the inherent inefficiency of converting unstructured relational potential into perfectly structured coherence. It is the cost of converting potential information into structured information. The universe is not perfectly efficient at converting potential (S₀) into actual (Patterns). Some computational "heat" is always generated.

9.2 **Relational Temperature (T<sub>rel</sub>):** A measure of the *intensity* and *frequency* of relational fluctuations and unresolved processing within a region of the network, particularly in the vacuum (S₀). High T<sub>rel</sub> corresponds to a highly active, turbulent vacuum state with rapid, energetic fluctuations (high *C* in transient patterns). Low T<sub>rel</sub> corresponds to a quieter, less active vacuum state. T<sub>rel</sub> influences the rate of pattern formation (S₁ from S₀), decay (lower *S* patterns are less stable in a high T<sub>rel</sub> environment), and interaction rates (*I_R*). The early universe was a state of very high T<sub>rel</sub> (intense S₀ activity), favoring rapid pattern formation and transformation. As the universe expanded and cooled (T<sub>rel</sub> decreased), the S₀ activity lessened, allowing more stable patterns to persist and composite structures to form. T<sub>rel</sub> is the "heat" of the relational network, the intensity of its fundamental processing noise. It's the average energy of the transient relational activity in the vacuum, which is governed by the dynamics of D's and R's (and their proto-properties) and the Cosmic Algorithm rules in S₀. It is the temperature of the computational substrate.

9.3 **Relational Work and Heat:** Relational Work is the process of transforming relational configurations to achieve or maintain Ontological Closure, mediated by the application of the Cosmic Algorithm rules and the expenditure of relational action (*h*). Relational Heat is the transfer of unstructured relational activity (S₀ fluctuations) between systems, increasing their internal relational tension or energy without necessarily increasing their structured coherence. The Second Law of Thermodynamics, stating that entropy (S<sub>rel</sub>) tends to increase in a closed system, reflects the fundamental drive of the universe's computation towards states of minimal relational tension and maximal coherence, but where some relational activity is always dissipated as unstructured heat (S₀ fluctuations) during transformations, increasing the overall S<sub>rel</sub> of the vacuum background. It reflects the inherent inefficiency of converting unstructured relational potential into perfectly structured actual, a form of fundamental computational heat loss. It is the cost of converting potential information into structured information. The universe is not perfectly efficient at converting potential (S₀) into actual (Patterns). Some computational "heat" is always generated.

9.4 **Arrow of Time (Emergent):** The thermodynamic arrow of time (entropy increase) is deeply linked to the drive towards higher *S* (stability/coherence) and the resolution of relational tension. While local regions can decrease S<sub>rel</sub> by forming stable patterns, the process of transformation and interaction always generates some degree of unstructured relational activity (heat) that increases the overall S<sub>rel</sub> of the vacuum. The universe evolves towards a state of maximal overall coherence (high total S) but also towards a state where the remaining unstructured relational activity (S₀) is uniformly distributed as low-intensity vacuum fluctuations (maximal total S<sub>rel</sub>, minimal T<sub>rel</sub>). Time flows in the direction of increasing overall S and S<sub>rel</sub>.

### 10.0 Relational Actualization: Crystallization from Potential

The transition from the vacuum state (S₀) – the realm of maximal potentiality and unstructured relational flux – to the emergence of stable patterns (S₁+) is a process of *Relational Actualization*. It is the universe locally fulfilling its logical possibilities by achieving Ontological Closure.

10.1 **The Spark of Distinction:** The process begins with the inherent dynamics of the S₀ state, driven by the Cosmic Algorithm and the proto-properties of D and R. Fluctuations constantly arise, forming transient configurations of D's and R's. These fluctuations are the universe exploring the vast space of possible relations, biased by the proto-properties (e.g., proto-polarity favors certain connections, proto-coherence potential biases towards certain groupings).

10.2 **Momentary Coherence:** When a local fluctuation happens to form a configuration of D's and R's (with compatible proto-properties) that *momentarily* satisfies the basic criteria for Ontological Closure, even minimally (S₁ potential), it becomes a potential pattern. This requires the local relational structure to be self-consistent according to the Validation/Closure Rule. This is a fleeting moment of local coherence in the S₀ flux. The probability of this occurring is governed by the Quantum Rule and the local texture of S₀ (influenced by proto-properties).

10.3 **Self-Reinforcement and Attractor Capture:** If this momentary coherence is sufficiently robust (high enough initial S potential) and the local relational noise is not overwhelming, the pattern's internal dynamics can begin to self-reinforce, drawing in nearby compatible D's and R's from the vacuum and solidifying its structure. This is the pattern "capturing" the local relational flow and potential, pulling it into its own self-validating cycle. It's like a tiny vortex forming in the sea of potential, drawing in the surrounding water to sustain itself. This process is driven by the inherent tendency towards minimal relational tension and the Economy of Existence (favoring higher S/C). The pattern enters an attractor basin in the phase space of relational configurations. The specific proto-properties of the D's and R's in the initial fluctuation and the surrounding S₀ bias which type of pattern (*P_ID*, *T*) actualizes.

10.4 **Crystallization and Persistence:** As the pattern self-reinforces, it "crystallizes" from the S₀ state, establishing a stable, self-sustaining relational structure with defined AQNs. It has successfully actualized a specific logical possibility for coherent existence. Its persistence depends on its ability to continuously maintain this closure against relational noise and perturbations, using its internal processing (driven by *C*, dictated by *T*, measured by *S*). This is the pattern actively re-computing itself into existence, consuming relational action (*h*) in its internal validation cycle.

10.5 **Relational Potential vs. Actual:** S₀ is the realm of pure *relational potentiality*. It has the *capacity* to form any possible relation or distinction. Stable patterns are regions where this potentiality has been *actualized* into definite, structured, self-consistent forms. The universe's evolution is the ongoing process of actualizing potential into stable reality, driven by the Cosmic Algorithm and the principle of OC, guided by Relational Aesthetics and Economy of Existence, and shaped by the inherent biases (proto-properties) of the primitives. The arrow of time is the direction of this actualization process, from less structured potential towards more structured actual reality.

### 11.0 The Grammar of Interaction (I_R): The Language of the Cosmos

The Interaction Rules (*I_R*) are not just a list of permitted couplings; they constitute the **formal language or grammar by which patterns can coherently relate, compose, and transform**, governed by the Cosmic Algorithm. They are derived directly from the topological compatibility (*T*) of the patterns involved and the overarching requirement for Ontological Closure in any resulting interaction or composite, heavily influenced by the proto-properties of the D's and R's constituting the patterns and involved in the interaction.

11.1 **I_R as Relational Syntax:** *I_R* define the valid sequences, combinations, and transformations of patterns. They are the "verbs" and "sentence structures" that can be formed using *P_ID*s as "nouns," ensuring that the resulting composite patterns or interactions are logically consistent and capable of achieving at least transient Ontological Closure. For example, an *I_R* might state that a pattern P<sub>A</sub> with topology T<sub>A</sub> (built from D's/R's with proto-P<sub>A</sub>) can compose with P<sub>B</sub> with T<sub>B</sub> (built from D's/R's with proto-P<sub>B</sub>) *only if* the resulting structure T<sub>composite</sub>(T<sub>A</sub>, T<sub>B</sub>) satisfies the minimum criteria for closure (S₄), and the proto-properties of the D's and R's at the interface are compatible according to the Composition Rules. *I_R* are the rules for how patterns can form valid relational "sentences" in the cosmic language. They are the rules of logical composition and transformation for stable patterns. They define the allowed operations in the cosmic computation at the pattern level. They are influenced by the local S₀ texture and the presence of other patterns.

11.2 **Force Carriers as Grammatical Operators:** Force-carrying patterns (photons, gluons, W/Z bosons) are the physical manifestations of these grammatical rules being applied. A photon is the pattern that represents the successful "electromagnetic relation" operation between two charged patterns (*T*s with specific asymmetry and D's with compatible proto-polarity). A gluon represents the "strong color composition" rule between quarks (*T*s with specific color topology and D's/R's with compatible proto-type). The exchange of a force carrier *is* the execution of a specific interaction rule, a transient pattern whose closure is validated by being successfully 'parsed' or 'integrated' by the receiving pattern. They are the 'function calls' or 'messages' that enable relational transformations. They are the dynamic elements that facilitate the building of more complex relational structures or the transformation of existing ones, according to the grammar. They are the "communication packets" of the relational network, carrying the instructions for how patterns should relate. They are the physical embodiment of the relational operators defined by the *I_R*. The specific properties of force carriers (mass, spin, range) are determined by their *C*, *T*, and *S*, which are derived from the minimal D/R configuration and proto-properties required to embody that specific interaction rule.

11.3 **The Hierarchy of Grammars:** Different sets of *I_R* define different fundamental "grammars" – the strong, weak, electromagnetic, and potentially other interaction types. These grammars are likely related to fundamental types of *R* (relations) at the deepest level (proto-properties of R), or different classes of topological compatibility rules (*T*) that are favored by the proto-properties of the D's and R's involved. The strength of a force could relate to the 'frequency' or 'ease' with which patterns can satisfy the rules of that grammar, or the 'computational cost' (*C* of the force carrier) of executing the rule, or the underlying "valence compatibility" defined by the proto-properties. Different forces represent different fundamental ways patterns can relate and compose to form coherent structures, each governed by its own set of grammatical rules determined by the Cosmic Algorithm and the proto-properties of D/R. The Standard Model forces are the emergent grammars of the universe's language of interaction.

11.4 **Forbidden Interactions:** Interactions that violate *I_R* are "ungrammatical" or "logically inconsistent" and cannot occur as stable phenomena. They would correspond to attempts to form configurations of D's and R's (with their proto-properties) that cannot achieve even transient Ontological Closure according to the fundamental rules. This explains why certain particle reactions or decays are forbidden – they represent sequences of relational transformations that are not permitted by the cosmic grammar. They are syntactically incorrect relational operations, computational states that cannot reach a valid halting point. They are logical contradictions in the language of interaction, often due to incompatible proto-properties or topological mismatches.

11.5 **The 'Lexicon' of P_ID's:** The Autaxic Table of Patterns (*P_ID*s) forms the fundamental "lexicon" of the cosmic language – the set of stable, self-validating 'words' that can be used to construct the universe's narrative through interactions and compositions.

11.6 **The Dynamics of Language Evolution:** Could the Cosmic Algorithm allow for subtle "evolution" or "learning" in the fundamental rules or *I_R* over cosmological timescales? Could the grammar itself change as the universe generates more complex structures and explores the phase space of possibility? This is highly speculative but raises the idea of a universe whose fundamental "language" is not fixed but dynamically self-modifying (Algorithmic Self-Modification). Perhaps the rules are not static axioms but dynamic principles that adapt based on the patterns they produce, favoring rules that lead to greater overall coherence and complexity in the long run, influenced by the Economy of Existence and Relational Aesthetics. This could be a form of meta-level Relational Aesthetics or Economy of Existence at play. Could the universe's grammar be a self-optimizing system, refining its rules over time to maximize the creation of stable, meaningful patterns? This would imply a universe that is not just running a fixed program, but is actively refining its own code. This could be linked to the proto-properties of D and R themselves having a dynamic aspect or evolving capacity, or to the influence of higher-order patterns (S₅+) on the application or weighting of the fundamental rules.

### 12.0 Relational Topology and Emergent Geometry

The pattern's *Topological Class (T)* is not just an internal descriptor; it plays a fundamental role in shaping the emergent geometry of spacetime. The universe's geometry is a large-scale consequence of the distribution and types of relational structures (*T*) that inhabit it.

12.1 **Geometry as Emergent Structure:** The geometric properties of space (distance, curvature, connectivity) are not pre-existing but emerge from the structure and dynamics of the relational network formed by D's and R's and stable patterns. The density and connectivity of relations, influenced by the presence of patterns (especially high-*C* patterns), define the local "shape" of this network.

12.2 **Topology's Role in Geometry:** The internal topology (*T*) of stable patterns influences the local geometry of the emergent network in two key ways:

12.2.1 **Local Network Deformation (Gravity):** High-*C* patterns, being dense knots of relational activity, locally increase the density of D's and R's and alter their connectivity patterns around the pattern. This local change in relational structure directly deforms the emergent geometry, which is perceived as gravity. The *type* of deformation is influenced by the pattern's *T* and the proto-properties of its constituents, as different *T*s might distribute relational tension or activity differently. For example, a pattern with a specific topological asymmetry (*T* linked to charge, rooted in proto-polarity) might induce different local relational biases in the vacuum than a symmetric pattern (*T* linked to spin-0).

12.2.2 **Imposing Relational Structure:** The *I_R* derived from a pattern's *T* dictate how it connects to other patterns. These connections are new edges in the emergent relational graph. The collective effect of many patterns forming relations according to their *I_R* builds the large-scale structure and connectivity of the spacetime network. The *type* of connections formed (e.g., specific R proto-types) influences the local geometry and topology of the emergent space. For instance, patterns with *I_R* that favor forming rigid, lattice-like connections (like the hypothetical Structuron) could introduce local regions of increased structural order or preferred directional pathways in spacetime, based on the proto-properties of the D's and R's involved in these connections.

12.3 **Emergent Dimensions:** The apparent 3+1 dimensions of spacetime could emerge from the **minimal number of degrees of freedom or relational connections required to uniquely specify the position and state of a distinction (D) or pattern within the evolving relational network**, given the constraints imposed by the Cosmic Algorithm and the proto-properties of D and R. If the fundamental rules and proto-properties naturally favor the formation of local relational neighborhoods where each D must maintain coherent relations with at least four other D's to achieve minimal stability (S₁), this could bias the network towards a structure that locally resembles a 4-dimensional lattice or graph. The perceived "flatness" of spacetime could be the emergent large-scale behavior of a highly connected, locally regular relational graph, where the density and types of connections are globally consistent on average, due to the prevalence of certain pattern types and S₀ dynamics governed by proto-properties. Higher relational dimensions could exist as latent topological or computational degrees of freedom in the underlying D/R graph that do not manifest macroscopically, perhaps related to the number of distinct proto-property types or the complexity of relational connections allowed by the rules. The dimensionality of spacetime might be a consequence of the most "economically efficient" or "aesthetically pleasing" way to achieve stable, propagating relational structures given the specific set of proto-properties of D and R.

12.4 **Dynamic Geometry (Gravitational Waves):** Since patterns can change state, interact, form composites, and decay, the underlying relational network is constantly being restructured. This means emergent geometry is not static but dynamic. Gravitational waves are propagating disturbances in this dynamic relational network geometry, caused by accelerating high-*C* patterns altering the local processing rate (*c*) and connectivity structure, as described by the Propagation Rules, influenced by proto-properties.

12.5 **Non-Euclidean Geometry:** The possibility of non-Euclidean geometry (curvature) arises naturally if the distribution of patterns (mass/energy density) is non-uniform, causing local variations in the density and connectivity of the relational network. The presence of Relational Defects could also introduce persistent non-Euclidean features or topological anomalies into the emergent geometry.

12.6 **Relational Distance:** Distance in emergent spacetime is fundamentally a measure of the *relational path length* between patterns – the number of fundamental D/R processing steps (*h*) or relational 'hops' required to propagate influence or information through the network, weighted by the "cost" or "resistance" of the relations along the path (influenced by R proto-properties and local *C*/*S* density). Geodesics (paths of shortest distance) are the paths of greatest relational efficiency or lowest computational cost through the network. Gravity warps spacetime by altering the cost and connectivity of relational paths, making paths towards high-*C* regions relationally "shorter".

12.7 **Topology of Spacetime:** The large-scale topology of spacetime (e.g., whether it's simply connected, has holes, is infinite) is determined by the global structure and connectivity of the entire relational network. Relational Defects could manifest as topological features of emergent spacetime (e.g., cosmic strings as line defects, domain walls as surface defects).
