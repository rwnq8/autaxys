## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1. Product Perspective & Vision

2.1.1.   **Relationship to Autaxys Research Program:**
    The Autologos Toolkit is not an end-product in itself but a critical **enabling system** for the Autaxys Research & Development Program. Its primary purpose is to augment the PI's capabilities, allowing a single researcher to manage and execute a program of foundational research that would typically require a larger team. It aims to systematize complex cognitive and administrative tasks, enforce methodological rigor, and ensure comprehensive knowledge management.

2.1.2.   **Grand Vision: A Cognitive Partnership System for Focused Execution and Iterative Progress in Foundational Research**
    The overarching vision for the Autologos Toolkit transcends the concept of mere AI assistance. It is conceived as a **Cognitive Partnership System**, specifically designed to address the unique challenges faced by a Principal Investigator (PI) with ADHD navigating the immense complexities of foundational research like the Autaxys program. The toolkit's ultimate aim is to create an "airtight" yet adaptable operational ecosystem that empowers the PI to:

    2.1.2.1.   **Navigate Complexity and Maintain Focus:**
        Foundational research, by its nature, involves a vast, interconnected web of ideas, interdisciplinary links, and potential avenues of inquiry. For a PI managing ADHD, this can lead to feeling "pulled in a million directions."
        *   **Toolkit Solution:** The Autologos Toolkit, particularly through the **AI Workflow Orchestrator (AIWO)**, will provide structured pathways through the research process. By integrating with the Master Plan's unique identifiers and the WBS, the AIWO will:
            *   Help the PI identify and prioritize critical path tasks and deliverables.
            *   Break down large, overwhelming goals into smaller, manageable, and actionable steps.
            *   Provide clear "next action" suggestions when the PI is unsure how to proceed, thus mitigating cognitive paralysis.
            *   Gently guide the PI back to "on-topic" work if explorations begin to diverge too far from current WBS/Master Plan priorities, acting as a focusing lens.

    2.1.2.2.   **Facilitate Task Completion and Deliverable Production ("Good For Now" Outputs):**
        The desire for perfection, common in research, can be amplified or become a barrier when managing ADHD, leading to endless iteration without tangible output.
        *   **Toolkit Solution:** The toolkit is designed to promote a philosophy of **iterative progress and "good for now" deliverables.**
            *   The **AIWO** and its integrated **AIPE Functionality** will facilitate the structured production of drafts (of Master Plan sections, AFKB entries, papers).
            *   Built-in QA services like the **AI Peer Reviewer (APR)** and **Critical Analysis Toolkit (CAT)** can provide initial feedback cycles, helping to achieve a solid "v0.1" or "v1.0" of a deliverable that can then be built upon, rather than striving for an unattainable "perfect" first version.
            *   The system will encourage a cycle of: **Use -> Learn -> Break -> Fix -> Iterate -> Output.** This means actively using the tools and the research outputs they help produce, identifying their shortcomings through that use, and then iteratively improving both the tools and the research content.

    2.1.2.3.   **Combat Unproductive Iteration and "Fiddling":**
        The PI explicitly notes the challenge of "endlessly fucking around with unproductive tasks or just endlessly iterating this app code thinking I'm going to make it 'perfect'." (Using PI's direct language for emphasis on the problem to be solved).
        *   **Toolkit Solution:**
            *   **Clear Task Boundaries:** The AIWO's management of WBS-linked tasks provides defined start and end points for specific activities.
            *   **Focus on Deliverables:** The system will consistently orient tasks towards producing specific, defined deliverables outlined in the Master Plan/WBS.
            *   **Structured Tool Development:** While the Autologos Toolkit itself is an evolving system, its development will also be guided by this SRD and linked to specific needs of the Autaxys research. The AIWO can help manage even the toolkit's own development tasks to prevent feature creep or endless refinement without deployment for actual research use.
            *   **Shifting Perfectionism to the Process:** The "perfection" sought will be in the *robustness and adaptability of the research and toolkit development process itself* (iterative, well-documented, version-controlled, provenance-tracked), rather than in achieving an impossible "perfect" state for any single app or research output at any given iteration.

    2.1.2.4.   **Provide Proactive Guidance and Reduce Cognitive Load:**
        The PI's statement, "The AI needs to guide the process: I certainly have opinions but if I don't know what to do next I can't do anything," is a core design driver.
        *   **Toolkit Solution:**
            *   The **AIWO** will proactively suggest next tasks based on priorities, dependencies, and workflow status.
            *   Dashboards or summaries provided by the AIWO will offer a clear overview of progress and pending items, reducing the mental effort of constantly re-evaluating the entire project landscape.
            *   Applications like **TFAS** will automate significant parts of the initial cognitive load of literature processing, presenting synthesized information for PI action.

    2.1.2.5.   **Co-evolution of Theory and Toolkit:**
        The Autologos Toolkit is not a static set of off-the-shelf tools. It will be custom-developed and refined by the PI in parallel with the Autaxys theory itself.
        *   **Toolkit Solution:** This allows the tools to be exquisitely tailored to the specific conceptual structures and methodological needs of autaxys. Insights from developing autaxys theory can directly inform the design of new AI app functionalities, and conversely, the experience of building and using the apps can provide heuristic insights or reveal new challenges/perspectives for the theory itself (Master Plan Section 8.8). This creates a powerful feedback loop.

In essence, the "Grand Vision" for the Autologos Toolkit is to create a deeply personalized, AI-augmented research environment. This environment will act as an extension of the PI's cognitive capabilities, providing structure, focus, and executional support to navigate the complexities of foundational research while mitigating the specific challenges associated with ADHD. It aims to transform the research process into a more manageable, productive, and ultimately more rewarding endeavor, enabling the PI to make substantial, iterative progress on the core research work and its associated deliverables.

### 2.2. Product Functions (Summary of Toolkit Capabilities)

## 3. Overall Toolkit Architecture Principles

The architecture of the Autologos Toolkit shall be guided by the following core principles, designed to realize the vision of a Cognitive Partnership System for focused execution and iterative progress, ensuring robustness, flexibility, and PI-centric control.

**3.1. Modular and Extensible Design**
    3.1.1.   **Principle:** The Autologos Toolkit shall be architected as a suite of distinct, specialized AI applications (modules), each with a clearly defined function and interface.
    3.1.2.   **Rationale:**
        3.1.2.1. Facilitates focused development and refinement of individual tools by the PI using platforms like Google AI Studio.
        3.1.2.2. Allows for independent testing and validation of each module's capabilities.
        3.1.2.3. Enhances overall system resilience; a failure or limitation in one module should not necessarily cripple the entire toolkit.
        3.1.2.4. Supports iterative development, where new applications can be added or existing ones updated/replaced as research needs evolve and AI capabilities advance, without requiring a complete system overhaul.
    3.1.3.   **Implications:**
        3.1.3.1. Clear API definitions or standardized interaction protocols (e.g., for data exchange, task initiation, status reporting) will be necessary for modules intended to be coordinated by the AI Workflow Orchestrator (AIWO).
        3.1.3.2. Each application's specific requirements, inputs, outputs, and dependencies will be documented (see Section 5).

**3.2. PI-Centric Control, Supervision, and Validation**
    3.2.1.   **Principle:** The Principal Investigator (PI) shall maintain ultimate control over all toolkit operations, guiding its actions, and validating all significant outputs. The toolkit augments PI capabilities, it does not replace PI judgment.
    3.2.2.   **Rationale:**
        3.2.2.1. Ensures that the research direction and intellectual integrity remain under the PI's purview, crucial for foundational theoretical work.
        3.2.2.2. Mitigates risks associated with AI errors, biases, or unverified "synthetic knowledge."
        3.2.2.3. Allows the PI's evolving insights and understanding of Autaxys theory to dynamically steer the toolkit's application.
    3.2.3.   **Implications:**
        3.2.3.1. All applications generating substantive content (text, code, analysis) must include clear mechanisms for PI review, feedback, and explicit approval before outputs are finalized or integrated into authoritative documents (e.g., Master Plan, AFKB).
        3.2.3.2. The AIWO must incorporate PI interaction points for decision-making and validation within automated workflows.
        3.2.3.3. The system design must prioritize transparency in how AI applications arrive at their outputs, allowing the PI to understand the basis for AI-generated suggestions or content.

**3.3. Deep Integration with Core Research Artifacts & Processes**
    3.3.1.   **Principle:** The Autologos Toolkit must be deeply and dynamically integrated with the primary research artifacts: the Autaxys Master Plan (MP), the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and the Autaxys Foundational Knowledge Base (AFKB).
    3.3.2.   **Rationale:**
        3.3.2.1. Enables the toolkit to operate with rich, relevant context, improving the quality and pertinence of AI assistance.
        3.3.2.2. Allows the toolkit to directly support and track progress against the strategic goals and tactical tasks defined in the MP and WBS.
        3.3.2.3. Ensures that the AFKB evolves as a living, accurate reflection of the research, updated through toolkit-assisted processes.
        3.3.2.4. Facilitates the "airtight system" vision where planning, execution, knowledge management, and output generation are coherently linked.
    3.3.3.   **Implications:**
        3.3.3.1. Standardized interfaces and protocols for toolkit applications to read from, query, and (with PI validation) write to the AFKB are required (see Section 7).
        3.3.3.2. The AIWO must be able to parse and utilize WBS task information and Master Plan section identifiers for task management and context provision.
        3.3.3.3. The unique hierarchical identifiers within the Master Plan v2.0 will be leveraged by the toolkit for precise referencing and targeted operations.

**3.4. Adherence to Autologos Core Directives and Ethical AI Operation**
    3.4.1.   **Principle:** All components of the Autologos Toolkit must operate in strict accordance with the overarching Autologos Core Directives and general principles of ethical AI use.
    3.4.2.   **Rationale:**
        3.4.2.1. Upholds the intellectual honesty and integrity of the research program.
        3.4.2.2. Ensures responsible use of AI technologies, particularly regarding data privacy (if applicable), bias mitigation (where possible through PI oversight), and transparency of AI's role.
        3.4.2.3. Guides the PI in the design and prompting of AI applications to align with project goals and avoid misuse.
    3.4.3.   **Implications:**
        3.4.3.1. Knowledge provenance (PI-authored, external source, AI-synthesized) must be meticulously tracked and clearly indicated (see Section 9).
        3.4.3.2. Applications generating novel content must be designed to minimize ungrounded speculation and clearly flag synthetic text that requires PI validation against citable sources or PI's original thought.
        3.4.3.3. The principles of good prompt engineering, previously conceptualized for an "AI LLM Instruction Reviewer" app, will be integrated into the PI's best practices for interacting with all toolkit modules.

**3.5. Emphasis on Robust Reproducibility, Provenance, and Versioning**
    3.5.1.   **Principle:** The toolkit must be designed and operated to maximize the reproducibility of research processes and the traceability (provenance) of all research artifacts and knowledge claims.
    3.5.2.   **Rationale:**
        3.5.2.1. Essential for scientific rigor and credibility, especially in foundational research.
        3.5.2.2. Allows the PI to reconstruct past research steps, understand the evolution of ideas, and identify the basis for specific conclusions.
        3.5.2.3. Facilitates compliance with Open Science principles and long-term archiving.
        3.5.2.4. Supports the iterative nature of the research, where understanding how a previous version of a concept or model was generated is crucial for its refinement.
    3.5.3.   **Implications:**
        3.5.3.1. Comprehensive logging of key PI-toolkit interactions, AI application parameters (if any), input data sources (with versions), and generated outputs for significant operations (see Section 9).
        3.5.3.2. Strict version control for all core documents (Master Plan, SRD, AFKB major states, key conceptual papers, application specifications, AIWO workflow definitions).
        3.5.3.3. The AIWO and AFKB interaction layer must support linking generated artifacts back to the specific workflow instance, PI prompts, and source data versions that produced them.

**3.6. Iterative Development and Co-evolution with Research Needs**
    3.6.1.   **Principle:** The Autologos Toolkit is not a static system but will be developed and refined iteratively by the PI, co-evolving with the Autaxys theory and the emerging methodological requirements of the research.
    3.6.2.   **Rationale:**
        3.6.2.1. Allows the toolkit to be precisely tailored to the unique and evolving demands of the Autaxys program.
        3.6.2.2. Enables rapid prototyping and deployment of new AI-driven functionalities as they are conceived or become necessary using tools like Google AI Studio.
        3.6.2.3. Reflects the learning process inherent in both foundational research and AI application development.
    3.6.3.   **Implications:**
        3.6.3.1. This SRD itself will be a living document, subject to versioning and updates as the toolkit evolves.
        3.6.3.2. The modular architecture (Principle 3.1) is critical to support this iterative development without destabilizing already functional components.
        3.6.3.3. The process for proposing, specifying, developing, and integrating new applications or features into the toolkit must be defined (potentially managed as tasks within the WBS and orchestrated by the AIWO for toolkit development itself).

## 4. Specific Requirements - AI Workflow Orchestrator (AIWO)

The AI Workflow Orchestrator (AIWO) is the central intelligent application within the Autologos Toolkit. Its primary purpose is to assist the PI in managing, coordinating, and partially automating multi-step research workflows. It acts as an intelligent layer between the PI, other specialized Autologos applications, the Autaxys Master Plan (MP), the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and the Autaxys Foundational Knowledge Base (AFKB).

**Crucially, the AIWO integrates core capabilities for iterative content generation and advanced autonomous exploration, subsuming the primary functionalities previously conceptualized as separate AIPE and ABAMPE applications.** This deep integration allows for more seamless and context-aware execution of complex research tasks involving both PI-guided iteration and AI-driven exploration.

**4.1. Workflow Definition & Management**
    4.1.1.   **REQ-AIWO-WD01: Workflow Creation & Customization Interface:**
        The AIWO shall provide an interface (e.g., structured text input, potentially a guided prompt-based system for PI development via Google AI Studio) enabling the PI to define new research workflows or customize existing templates.
        4.1.1.1. Workflow definitions must specify a sequence of tasks.

            5.2.2.3.2. If a URL is present, shall attempt to check its accessibility (e.g., perform a HEAD request or simulated browse) and flag dead or redirected links. (This functionality requires careful implementation regarding network access and security).
            5.2.2.3.3. The application will clearly state when it's using "mock search and browse tools" for demonstration versus actual network calls for validation, as per its original conceptual description.
        5.2.2.4.   **REQ-ARV-F04: Cross-Referencing with AFKB Bibliography:**
            5.2.2.4.1. Shall be able to compare input citations against a master bibliography maintained within or accessible from the AFKB.

**5.3. Critical Analysis Toolkit (CAT) - Analytical Services**
    *Cross-reference: Conceptualized based on toolkit image and iterative refinement needs.*

    5.3.1.   **Purpose:**
        The Critical Analysis Toolkit (CAT) provides a suite of AI-driven analytical **services** designed to be integrated throughout the research lifecycle. Its purpose is to assist the PI in proactively identifying potential weaknesses, unstated assumptions, logical inconsistencies, alternative perspectives, and blind spots in theoretical arguments, conceptual explanations, draft papers, Master Plan sections, and other textual artifacts related to Autaxys. By embedding critical analysis at multiple stages, CAT aims to continually enhance the rigor, coherence, and defensibility of the Autaxys framework and its outputs, making Quality Assurance (QA) an integral part of the workflow rather than a separate final process.

    5.3.2.   **Functional Requirements (as Callable Services/Functions):**
        The AIWO or PI can invoke specific CAT analytical services on a given text input, along with relevant context. Each service will return a structured analysis.

        5.3.2.1.   **REQ-CAT-FSVC-Input: Text Input & Contextualization for Services:**
            5.3.2.1.1. All CAT services shall accept a segment of text as primary input.
            5.3.2.1.2. All CAT services shall accept relevant contextual information (e.g., specific autaxic principles being discussed, AFKB definitions, purpose of the text) to refine their analysis. This context will typically be provided by the AIWO as part of an orchestrated workflow step or directly by the PI.
        5.3.2.2.   **REQ-CAT-FSVC-LCC: Logical Consistency Check Service:**
            *Function:* Analyzes input text for internal logical consistency.

            *Output:* List of critiques or alternative perspectives.
        5.3.2.5.   **REQ-CAT-FSVC-BS: Blind Spot Identification Service:**
            *Function:* Suggests areas, perspectives, or implications the input text may have overlooked or not sufficiently addressed, based on provided context or general knowledge relevant to the domain.
            *Output:* List of potential blind spots or areas for further consideration.
        5.3.2.6.   **REQ-CAT-FSVC-AVD: Ambiguity & Vagueness Detection Service:**
            *Function:* Highlights terms or statements within the input text that may be ambiguous, vague, or require further clarification for precision.
            *Output:* Annotated text or list of identified ambiguities.
        5.3.2.7.   **REQ-CAT-FSVC-AFKB: AFKB Consistency Check Service:**
            *Function:* Compares arguments or definitions in the input text against established and PI-validated concepts within the AFKB (using AFKB context provided).
            *Output:* Report flagging potential discrepancies or inconsistencies with existing AFKB knowledge.
        5.3.2.8.   **REQ-CAT-FSVC-Output: Structured Feedback Output from Services:**
            5.3.2.8.1. Each CAT service shall return its analysis in a structured format (e.g., JSON, structured Markdown list) suitable for processing by the AIWO or direct review by the PI.
            5.3.2.8.2. Feedback should be targeted, actionable, and aim to be constructive.
        5.3.2.9.   **REQ-CAT-FSVC-WorkflowIntegration: AIWO Integration for Services:**
            5.3.2.9.1. The AIWO shall be able to invoke any CAT service as a distinct step within a defined workflow.
            5.3.2.9.2. The AIWO shall manage the passing of input text and context to the CAT service and the reception of its structured analysis report.
            5.3.2.9.3. The AIWO can then route the CAT analysis to the PI for review or use it as input for subsequent workflow steps (e.g., providing it as feedback to the AIPE functionality for text revision).

    5.3.3.   **Inputs (to individual CAT services, typically via AIWO):**
        5.3.3.1.   Target text segment for analysis.
        5.3.3.2.   Specific CAT service(s) to be invoked.

        5.3.4.2.   Service completion status and diagnostic log.
    5.3.5.   **Non-Functional Considerations:**
        5.3.5.1.   **Heuristic Aid:** Outputs are sophisticated heuristic aids for the PI's critical thinking, not definitive proofs. LLM limitations in deep logical reasoning must be acknowledged.
        5.3.5.2.   **Configurability:** The PI should be able to configure the "intensity" or "persona" of certain services (like Adversarial Critique).
    5.3.6.   **AFKB Interaction:**
        5.3.6.1.   CAT services primarily read AFKB context provided by AIWO to inform their analysis.
        5.3.6.2.   CAT outputs (critiques, identified assumptions) do not directly write to AFKB but are used by the PI to inform PI-led revisions of AFKB content or other documents.

**5.4. AI Peer Reviewer (APR) - Simulated Review Services**
    *Cross-reference: Conceptualized based on toolkit image.*

    5.4.1.   **Purpose:**
        The AI Peer Reviewer (APR) provides a suite of AI-driven **simulated review services** designed to offer constructive, critical feedback on mature draft research outputs (e.g., academic papers, book chapters, comprehensive reports, significant Master Plan updates). APR aims to emulate aspects of a traditional peer review process, helping the PI identify areas for improvement in argumentation, structure, clarity, evidentiary support, and overall scholarly presentation before wider dissemination or submission. This serves as a crucial internal QA step.

    5.4.2.   **Functional Requirements (as Callable Services/Functions):**
        The AIWO or PI can invoke APR services on a complete draft document, along with relevant context (like target journal type or audience, if applicable).

            *Function:* Performs a focused review of the main arguments presented, assessing their logical soundness, the adequacy of supporting evidence (as presented in the text), and the way counterarguments or limitations are addressed.
            *Output:* Detailed feedback on specific arguments, pointing out strengths, weaknesses, gaps in evidence, or areas where reasoning could be improved. (May leverage or suggest follow-up with specific CAT services).
        5.4.2.4.   **REQ-APR-FSVC-StructureClarity: Structural & Presentation Clarity Review Service:**
            *Function:* Assesses the overall organization, section flow, clarity of headings, paragraph structure, and general readability of the document.
            *Output:* Suggestions for improving structure, flow, transitions, and clarity of expression for the intended audience.
        5.4.2.5.   **REQ-APR-FSVC-MethodologyCritique: Methodological Rigor Review Service (if applicable):**

            *Output:* Feedback on the methodological aspects of the document.
        5.4.2.6.   **REQ-APR-FSVC-PersonaReview: Simulated Reviewer Persona Service (Optional):**
            *Function:* Allows the PI to request a review from a simulated "persona" (e.g., "a skeptical physicist from a competing paradigm," "a philosopher focused on ontological clarity," "a general science reader").
            *Output:* Review feedback framed from the requested persona's likely perspective, highlighting points they might find compelling or problematic.
        5.4.2.7.   **REQ-APR-FSVC-Output: Comprehensive Structured Review Report:**
            5.4.2.7.1. Each APR service (or a combined invocation) shall produce a comprehensive, structured review report.
            5.4.2.7.2. The report should categorize feedback (e.g., "Major Revisions Suggested," "Minor Revisions," "Strengths," "Weaknesses," "Specific Comments per Section") similar to academic peer review.
            5.4.2.7.3. Feedback should be specific, constructive, and provide actionable recommendations where possible.
        5.4.2.8.   **REQ-APR-FSVC-WorkflowIntegration: AIWO Integration for Review Services:**
            5.4.2.8.1. The AIWO shall be able to invoke APR services as a distinct step in a "Document Finalization" or "Pre-Dissemination QA" workflow.
            5.4.2.8.2. The AIWO shall manage passing the full document and relevant context to the APR service(s).
            5.4.2.8.3. The AIWO shall receive the structured review report, which can then be presented to the PI and used as input for a final revision cycle using AIPE functionality.

    5.4.3.   **Inputs (to APR services, typically via AIWO):**
        5.4.3.1.   Full draft document for review.
        5.4.3.2.   (Via AIWO/PI) Specific APR service(s) or review focus requested.
        5.4.3.3.   (Via AIWO/PI) Contextual information (research questions, audience, key AFKB concepts, PI concerns).
    5.4.4.   **Outputs (from APR services, returned to AIWO/PI):**
        5.4.4.1.   Comprehensive structured peer review report.
        5.4.4.2.   List of specific actionable recommendations.
        5.4.4.3.   Service completion status and diagnostic log.
    5.4.5.   **Non-Functional Considerations:**
        5.4.5.1.   **Quality of Simulation:** The APR provides a *simulation* of peer review. While aiming for insightful feedback, it cannot replace human expert review. Its outputs are for PI internal QA and improvement.
        5.4.5.2.   **Configurability:** The PI should be able to guide the "expertise" or "critical lens" of the APR to some extent (e.g., through persona selection or by highlighting areas for focused critique).
        5.4.5.3.   **Objectivity:** The APR should aim for balanced feedback, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses, unless a specific adversarial persona is requested.
    5.4.6.   **AFKB Interaction:**
        5.4.6.1.   Reads AFKB context (key concepts, established theoretical points) provided by AIWO to understand the document's grounding within the Autaxys framework.
        5.4.6.2.   Its review might highlight areas where the document diverges from or needs to better connect with existing AFKB knowledge, which the PI can then address.
        5.4.6.3.   Does not directly write to AFKB.

**5.5. (Placeholder for other future applications)**
    5.5.1. As the Autaxys research progresses, new specialized AI application needs may arise (e.g., dedicated tools for formal model checking assistance, visualization generation from structured data, advanced statistical analysis of simulation data, more sophisticated AFKB graph navigation and inference).
    5.5.2. New applications will be specified with their own set of requirements within this SRD structure (e.g., as Section 5.X) and integrated into the AIWO framework or used standalone. Potential future applications could include:
        5.5.2.1.   **Formal Model Assistant (FMA):** Assists in translating conceptual autaxic principles into specific formalisms (e.g., suggesting pi-calculus syntax for a relational process), checking basic consistency of formal statements.
        5.5.2.2.   **Simulation Data Analyzer (SDA):** Processes output data from computational simulations of autaxic models (Project 6.2), performs statistical analysis, and generates summaries or visualizations of emergent behaviors.
        5.5.2.3.   **AFKB Visualizer & Navigator (AVN):** Provides graphical interfaces for exploring the AFKB knowledge graph, helping PI identify clusters of concepts, distant relationships, or areas needing more connectivity.

## 6. PI Interaction & User Experience (UX) Principles for the Toolkit

This section outlines the guiding principles for the Principal Investigator's (PI) interaction with the Autologos Toolkit and the desired user experience. These principles aim to ensure the toolkit is intuitive, efficient, and empowering for a single PI managing a complex research program, particularly when developing and using applications within Google AI Studio.

**6.1. General Principles**
    6.1.1.   **REQ-UX-GP01: PI as Director and Final Authority:** All toolkit interactions must reinforce the PI's role as the director of the research and the final arbiter of all content and decisions. AI outputs are suggestions or drafts, never autonomous pronouncements.
    6.1.2.   **REQ-UX-GP02: Clarity and Transparency:**
        6.1.2.1. The purpose of each application and the expected inputs/outputs should be clear to the PI.
        6.1.2.2. When AI makes inferences or syntheses, the basis for these (e.g., source documents, AFKB context used) should be as transparent as possible to aid PI validation.
    6.1.3.   **REQ-UX-GP03: Simplicity and Minimized Cognitive Load:**
        6.1.3.1. Interfaces (primarily prompt-based for AI Studio apps) should be as simple and intuitive as possible.
        6.1.3.2. The toolkit should reduce, not increase, the PI's cognitive load for routine tasks.
    6.1.4.   **REQ-UX-GP04: Focus on Actionable Outputs:** Toolkit applications should produce outputs that are directly usable by the PI or other applications in the research workflow (e.g., well-structured text, clear analysis, actionable suggestions).
    6.1.5.   **REQ-UX-GP05: Iterative and Forgiving Design:** The PI must be able to easily iterate on prompts, inputs, and AI-generated outputs. The system should be forgiving of minor PI errors in instruction, perhaps prompting for clarification.

**6.2. Input Methods**
    6.2.1.   **REQ-UX-IM01: Primary Input via Prompts:** The primary method for PI interaction with individual AI Studio-built applications will be through natural language prompts, potentially augmented with structured parameters.
    6.2.2.   **REQ-UX-IM02: Context Provision:**
        6.2.2.1. The PI must be able to easily provide or reference necessary context for app operations (e.g., by pointing to AFKB nodes, WBS items, specific files, or pasting text).
        6.2.2.2. The AIWO, when orchestrating, will be responsible for assembling and passing much of this context automatically based on workflow definitions.
    6.2.3.   **REQ-UX-IM03: File Uploads:** Applications like TFAS (and potentially others) must support straightforward uploading or referencing of local/cloud-based files as input.
    6.2.4.   **REQ-UX-IM04: Selections from AI-Generated Options:** Where an app generates multiple options or suggestions (e.g., CAT generating alternative perspectives), the PI interface must allow for easy selection or ranking.

**6.3. Output Presentation**
    6.3.1.   **REQ-UX-OP01: Structured Textual Outputs:** Most outputs should be in clear, well-structured Markdown or plain text, suitable for direct use, review, or ingestion into other systems (like Obsidian/AFKB).
    6.3.2.   **REQ-UX-OP02: Summaries and Highlights:** Applications performing analysis (TFAS, CAT, APR) should provide executive summaries or highlight key findings for quick PI assessment before diving into details.
    6.3.3.   **REQ-UX-OP03: Clear Differentiation of Output Types:** It must be clear to the PI whether an output is a direct extraction, an AI-generated summary, an AI-generated critique, a new synthetic concept, etc., to manage provenance.
    6.3.4.   **REQ-UX-OP04: Visualization (Feasibility-Dependent):** While core functionality is text-based, if Google AI Studio or integrated tools easily support simple visualizations for certain analyses (e.g., term frequency from TFAS, workflow status from AIWO), these should be considered for enhancing PI understanding. This is a "nice-to-have" rather than a core requirement for initial app versions.

**6.4. Feedback and Iteration Mechanisms**
    6.4.1.   **REQ-UX-FI01: Direct Feedback on Drafts:** For applications like the AIPE functionality within AIWO, the PI must be able to provide direct feedback (e.g., "rephrase this paragraph," "expand on this point using AFKB node X," "remove this argument") to guide iterative refinement.
    6.4.2.   **REQ-UX-FI02: Iteration History (Conceptual):** While full diffing might be complex, the AIWO or AIPE should conceptually support tracking major versions of iteratively refined documents within a workflow instance, allowing PI to refer back to earlier states if needed (PI manages file versions).
    6.4.3.   **REQ-UX-FI03: Clear Prompts for PI Decisions:** When a workflow pauses for PI input (e.g., after a CAT analysis), the AIWO must clearly state what is needed from the PI and what the consequences of different choices are for the workflow.

## 7. AFKB Integration and Data Flow Requirements (Toolkit-Wide)

This section outlines the requirements for how the Autologos Toolkit applications, whether operating standalone under PI direction or orchestrated by the AI Workflow Orchestrator (AIWO), will interact with the Autaxys Foundational Knowledge Base (AFKB). The AFKB is the central knowledge repository, and its effective integration is critical for the toolkit's contextual awareness and ability to support the research program. For initial implementation, the AFKB is assumed to be an Obsidian vault of interlinked Markdown files, potentially evolving to more structured database/graph systems.

**7.1. Reading From and Querying the AFKB (Context Provision)**
    7.1.1.   **REQ-AFKB-R01: Access to AFKB Content:**
        All relevant Autologos Toolkit applications must be able to access and process the content of specified AFKB files (Markdown notes) when provided as context by the PI or AIWO.
    7.1.2.   **REQ-AFKB-R02: Targeted Content Retrieval for Prompts:**
        The PI, or the AIWO as part of a workflow, must be able to specify and provide relevant AFKB sections, concept definitions, or linked notes as direct contextual input to an AI application's prompt (e.g., "Use the definition of 'Ontological Closure' from AFKB node [ObsidianLinkToNode] to analyze this argument").
    7.1.3.   **REQ-AFKB-R03: Semantic Search/Query Capability (Assisted by AI):**
        7.1.3.1.   The toolkit (potentially via a dedicated AFKB interface app or AIWO function leveraging an app like TFAS) should assist the PI in finding relevant information within the AFKB based on semantic queries or keyword searches.
        7.1.3.2.   The output of such queries should be structured excerpts or lists of relevant AFKB notes/sections that can then be fed as context to other applications.
    7.1.4.   **REQ-AFKB-R04: Understanding AFKB Link Structure (Conceptual):**
        While direct graph traversal might be advanced, applications processing AFKB content should be prompted to pay attention to Markdown/Wikilinks to understand relationships between concepts, and this understanding should inform their outputs (e.g., syntheses, analyses).
    7.1.5.   **REQ-AFKB-R05: Version Awareness (PI Managed, Toolkit Supported):**
        When providing AFKB context, the PI is responsible for ensuring the relevant version of AFKB content is used. The toolkit should support workflows where specific versions of AFKB documents (if managed via Git/version control by PI) can be referenced.

**7.2. Suggesting Additions/Modifications to AFKB (PI-Validated Writes)**
    7.2.1.   **REQ-AFKB-W01: Structured Suggestions for New Content:**
        Applications like TFAS or AIPE (AIWO's internal engine), after processing information or generating new conceptual content, shall be able to output *suggestions* for new AFKB entries (e.g., new concept nodes, definitions, elaborations) in a structured Markdown format.
    7.2.2.   **REQ-AFKB-W02: Suggestions for Modifying Existing Content:**
        Applications may suggest modifications or additions to existing AFKB notes based on their analysis or newly generated insights. These suggestions must clearly indicate the original content and the proposed changes.
    7.2.3.   **REQ-AFKB-W03: Highlighting Potential Links:**
        Applications should be able to suggest new Markdown links between existing AFKB notes or between new suggested content and existing notes, based on identified conceptual relationships.
    7.2.4.   **REQ-AFKB-W04: PI Validation Gate:**
        **Crucially, no Autologos Toolkit application shall directly write to or modify AFKB files without explicit PI review and approval.** All suggestions for AFKB additions/modifications must be presented to the PI for validation, editing, and manual integration into the AFKB (e.g., by the PI copying and pasting validated Markdown into Obsidian). The AIWO may manage a queue of such pending AFKB updates for PI review.
    7.2.5.   **REQ-AFKB-W05: Formatting for AFKB Ingestion:**
        AI-generated suggestions for AFKB content must be formatted in clean, standard Markdown, adhering to any PI-defined templates or structural conventions for AFKB notes to minimize PI reformatting effort.

**7.3. Data Formats for AFKB Interaction and Inter-App Communication**
    7.3.1.   **REQ-AFKB-DF01: Markdown as Primary Format for AFKB Textual Content:**
        The primary format for textual knowledge within the AFKB (concept definitions, elaborations, notes) will be Markdown, leveraging Obsidian's linking and organizational features. Autologos apps must be proficient in parsing and generating well-structured Markdown.
    7.3.2.   **REQ-AFKB-DF02: JSON/Structured Text for Metadata and Complex Data:**
        For passing structured data between apps (e.g., TFAS analysis results to AIWO, AIWO parameters to an app), or for storing complex metadata within AFKB (e.g., properties of a concept node beyond its textual description), JSON or another well-defined structured text format should be used.
    7.3.3.   **REQ-AFKB-DF03: Standardized Output from Analytical Apps:**
        Apps like TFAS, CAT, and APR shall produce their analytical reports in a consistent, structured format (e.g., predefined Markdown structure or JSON schema) that the AIWO can reliably parse to extract key findings or guide subsequent workflow steps.

**7.4. Ensuring AFKB Integrity During Interaction**
    7.4.1.   **REQ-AFKB-INT01: Read-Only Access by Default (for context):**
        When applications require AFKB content for context, they should access it in a read-only manner unless explicitly part of a PI-validated "suggestion for update" workflow.
    7.4.2.   **REQ-AFKB-INT02: Isolation of AI Processing:**
        AI processing of AFKB content (e.g., for summarization by TFAS or critique by CAT) should operate on copies or excerpts of the data, not directly on the canonical AFKB files, to prevent accidental corruption. The AIWO will manage this data staging.
    7.4.3.   **REQ-AFKB-INT03: Validation of AFKB References in Prompts:**
        When PI or AIWO provides links/references to AFKB nodes in prompts, the system (perhaps AIWO or a utility function) should ideally perform a basic check to ensure the referenced note exists, flagging broken links to the PI.
    7.4.4.   **REQ-AFKB-INT04: Consistency Checks (Assisted by CAT/AIWO):**
        As the AFKB grows, the CAT's AFKB Consistency Check service (REQ-CAT-FSVC-AFKB), orchestrated by AIWO, can be periodically run on subsets of the AFKB to help the PI identify potential conceptual drift or inconsistencies between related notes.

**7.5. Data Flow Between PI, AIWO, Apps, and AFKB (Conceptual)**
    7.5.1.   **Typical Read Flow (Context Gathering):**
        PI/AIWO identifies need for AFKB context -> AIWO/PI queries AFKB (possibly via TFAS-like search if broad) -> Relevant AFKB content (Markdown/JSON) retrieved -> Context provided to target App (e.g., AIPE, CAT).
    7.5.2.   **Typical Output/Suggestion Flow (Content Generation/Analysis):**
        App processes input + context -> App generates output (Markdown draft, JSON analysis) -> Output returned to AIWO -> AIWO presents to PI for review/validation -> PI validates/edits ->
            IF (output is for a deliverable): PI incorporates into deliverable file.
            IF (output suggests AFKB update): PI manually integrates validated content into AFKB.
    7.5.3.   **Direct PI-AFKB Interaction:** The PI always retains the ability to directly create, edit, and link notes within the AFKB (Obsidian vault) outside of any Autologos Toolkit workflow. The toolkit is an assistant, not a gatekeeper.

## 8. Core Operational & Non-Functional Needs (Simplified & PI-Focused)

This section outlines key operational and non-functional needs for the Autologos Toolkit, focusing on practical aspects relevant to a single PI developing and using the system, primarily through Google AI Studio. These are not exhaustive enterprise-level NFRs but rather guiding considerations for usability and effectiveness.

**8.1. Performance Expectations (Interactive & Task-Appropriate)**
    8.1.1.   **REQ-PERF-01: Interactive Response for Core Tasks:**
        For frequently used, PI-interactive tasks (e.g., a single iteration with AIPE functionality within AIWO, a quick CAT analysis on a paragraph, an ARV check on a few citations), response times from the AI applications should generally be within a range that maintains an interactive workflow (e.g., typically under 1-2 minutes, PI to define acceptable thresholds based on AI Studio capabilities).
    8.1.2.   **REQ-PERF-02: Batch Processing for Larger Tasks:**
        For more extensive tasks (e.g., TFAS processing of multiple large documents, AIWO orchestrating a long workflow), the system should be designed to run as a background process if feasible within AI Studio, or clearly indicate expected longer processing times. The PI should be able to continue other work or be notified upon completion.
    8.1.3.   **REQ-PERF-03: AFKB Query Speed:**
        Retrieval of contextual information from the AFKB (Obsidian vault) by AIWO or other apps should be efficient enough not to significantly delay task execution. (This may depend on PI's local system performance and AFKB size/structure).

**8.2. Reliability & Error Handling (PI-Centric)**
    8.2.1.   **REQ-REL-01: Graceful Handling of AI API Issues:**
        All applications interacting with the Gemini API (or other external AI services) must gracefully handle common API errors (e.g., rate limits, timeouts, service unavailability).
        8.2.1.1.   The application should clearly inform the PI of the API error.
        8.2.1.2.   The application should allow the PI to easily retry the operation.
        8.2.1.3.   The AIWO, if orchestrating, should log the error and offer PI-guided recovery options for the workflow (as per REQ-AIWO-EH03).
    8.2.2.   **REQ-REL-02: Handling of Unexpected AI Outputs:**
        If an AI application produces an output that is malformed, irrelevant, or clearly nonsensical (despite prompt engineering), the PI should be able to easily flag this, discard the output, and retry the operation, perhaps with a modified prompt. The system should not crash due to unexpected AI content.
    8.2.3.   **REQ-REL-03: Input Validation (Basic):**
        Applications should perform basic validation on PI inputs where appropriate (e.g., checking if a provided file path exists for TFAS) and provide clear error messages to the PI if inputs are invalid, before making API calls.
    8.2.4.   **REQ-REL-04: Workflow State Preservation:**
        The AIWO must reliably save the state of active workflows so they can be paused and resumed, even across PI work sessions or minor system restarts (feasibility depends on AI Studio capabilities and PI's setup).

**8.3. Data Integrity & Backup (PI Responsibility, Toolkit Support)**
    8.3.1.   **REQ-DI-01: Non-Destructive Operations on AFKB:**
        As a core principle (REQ-AFKB-INT01, REQ-AFKB-W04), no Autologos Toolkit application will directly modify canonical AFKB files. All changes are PI-mediated based on AI suggestions. This is the primary safeguard against AI-induced data corruption in the AFKB.
    8.3.2.   **REQ-DI-02: PI-Managed Backup Strategy:**
        The PI is responsible for implementing and maintaining a robust backup strategy for the entire `projects/AUTX/` directory, including the AFKB (Obsidian vault), AI Studio project files for each app, the SRD itself, and all research outputs. The toolkit does not provide its own backup system.
    8.3.3.   **REQ-DI-03: Clear Output Destinations:**
        Workflows and applications should have clear, PI-configurable (or consistently defined) output locations for generated drafts and reports to avoid accidental overwriting of critical files. Versioning is PI-managed, potentially assisted by AIWO naming conventions.

**8.4. Modularity & Maintainability (From PI's Development Perspective in AI Studio)**
    8.4.1.   **REQ-MM-01: Independent App Logic:**
        The core logic (prompts, configurations, minimal code) for each distinct Autologos application (TFAS, ARV, CAT, APR) developed in AI Studio should be as self-contained as possible, even if it expects context from AIWO. This allows the PI to update or refine one app without necessarily breaking others.
    8.4.2.   **REQ-MM-02: Clarity of Prompts & Configurations:**
        The prompts and configurations defining each app's behavior in AI Studio should be well-commented and structured by the PI to be understandable and modifiable over time, referencing relevant SRD requirements.
    8.4.3.   **REQ-MM-03: AIWO Workflow Definition Maintainability:**
        Workflow definitions for the AIWO should be in a human-readable and PI-editable format, allowing for easy modification of task sequences, parameters, and conditional logic.
    8.4.4.   **REQ-MM-04: Versioning of App Logic/Prompts (PI Managed):**
        The PI is responsible for versioning the core prompts/configurations of each AI Studio application as they are developed and refined (e.g., using file naming conventions or a separate Git repository for AI Studio project assets).

**8.5. Usability (Simplified from a PI Developer/User Perspective)**
    8.5.1.   **REQ-USAB-01: Consistent Interaction Patterns:**
        Where feasible, similar types of PI interactions (e.g., providing input, reviewing drafts, making decisions) should follow consistent patterns across different workflows managed by AIWO.
    8.5.2.   **REQ-USAB-02: Clear Instructions & Feedback:**
        The AIWO and individual apps must provide clear instructions to the PI when input or action is required, and give understandable feedback on task status or errors.
    8.5.3.   **REQ-USAB-03: Minimizing Unnecessary Complexity:**
        The design of workflows and app interactions should avoid unnecessary steps or overly complex configurations that would burden the PI. The focus is on achieving the core functional requirements effectively.

## 9. Provenance and Reproducibility (Core Functional Requirement)

Ensuring robust provenance tracking and facilitating research reproducibility are core, non-negotiable functional requirements for the Autologos Toolkit. Given the collaborative nature of the PI-AI interaction and the iterative generation of knowledge and artifacts, meticulous records must be kept to allow for tracing the origin of ideas, validating outputs, and reconstructing research pathways. This aligns with the ethical principles outlined in the Autaxys Master Plan (Section 7.7) and fundamental scientific best practices.

**9.1. Logging of Key Interactions and AI-Generated Content**
    9.1.1.   **REQ-PR-L01: AIWO Workflow Execution Logs:**
        As specified in REQ-AIWO-LP01, the AI Workflow Orchestrator (AIWO) shall maintain comprehensive logs for each executed workflow instance. These logs are fundamental for reproducibility and must include:
        9.1.1.1.   Unique workflow instance identifier (linkable to WBS/MP items).
        9.1.1.2.   Version of the workflow definition used.
        9.1.1.3.   Timestamps (start, end, key intermediate steps).
        9.1.1.4.   Sequence of tasks executed, including the specific Autologos app invoked or PI action taken.
        9.1.1.5.   For each AI app task:
            9.1.1.5.1.   The exact prompt or key input parameters provided to the app.
            9.1.1.5.2.   References (e.g., filenames, AFKB node IDs, version hashes if available) to contextual data used (e.g., AFKB excerpts, source documents).
            9.1.1.5.3.   The complete AI-generated output (or a hash/reference if the output is very large, with the full output archived separately but linkable).
            9.1.1.5.4.   Version of the AI model/API used (e.g., "Gemini-X.Y Model, API call on YYYY-MM-DD"), if programmatically accessible or manually noted by PI.
        9.1.1.6.   All PI inputs, decisions, and validations made at designated workflow interaction points.
        9.1.1.7.   Any errors encountered and recovery actions taken.
    9.1.2.   **REQ-PR-L02: Standalone App Interaction Logging (Conceptual):**
        When PI uses a constituent Autologos app standalone (outside an AIWO workflow), the PI is responsible for manually documenting key inputs, prompts, and outputs if they contribute significantly to research artifacts or AFKB. The app's design (e.g., in AI Studio) should facilitate easy copying of prompts and outputs for this purpose. (Future: Apps might offer a simple "log interaction" feature).
    9.1.3.   **REQ-PR-L03: Log Storage and Accessibility:**
        Workflow logs generated by AIWO should be stored in a consistent, PI-accessible location (e.g., a dedicated subdirectory within `projects/AUTX/03_Autologos_System/Workflow_Logs/`), ideally in a human-readable or easily parsable format (e.g., structured text, JSONL, Markdown).
    9.1.4.   **REQ-PR-L04: Linking Logs to Artifacts:**
        Mechanisms (even if PI-managed initially) should exist to link generated research artifacts (e.g., a draft paper, an AFKB node) back to the specific AIWO workflow instance log(s) that contributed to their creation.

**9.2. Versioning Strategy for Key Artifacts (PI Managed with Toolkit Support)**
    9.2.1.   **REQ-PR-V01: Master Plan & SRD Versioning:**
        The Autaxys Master Plan (all segmented files) and this Autologos Toolkit SRD shall be strictly version-controlled by the PI (e.g., using Git for local history, with major versions archived on Zenodo as per Master Plan Sec 12.1.3).
    9.2.2.   **REQ-PR-V02: AFKB Versioning (Conceptual / PI Implemented):**
        The PI will manage versioning of the AFKB (Obsidian vault). This may involve periodic snapshots, use of Obsidian's built-in file recovery, or integration with Git. The Autologos Toolkit should assume that AFKB content provided as context can be considered as "current version" unless otherwise specified by the PI.
    9.2.3.   **REQ-PR-V03: Autologos App Logic/Prompt Versioning (PI Managed):**
        The core prompts, configurations, and any minimal code defining each custom AI application built in Google AI Studio are critical research assets. The PI is responsible for versioning these (e.g., through AI Studio's inherent capabilities if any, or by exporting/saving configurations with versioned filenames in `projects/AUTX/03_Autologos_System/Autologos_App_Specifications/AppName_vX.Y_config.txt`).
    9.2.4.   **REQ-PR-V04: AIWO Workflow Definition Versioning:**
        As per REQ-AIWO-WD02, workflow definitions managed by the AIWO must be version-controlled. Workflow execution logs (REQ-PR-L01) must reference the specific version of the workflow definition used.
    9.2.5.   **REQ-PR-V05: Research Output Versioning (PI Managed):**
        Drafts and final versions of research outputs (papers, reports) will be version-controlled by the PI using standard practices (e.g., filename conventions, Git). The Autologos Toolkit (e.g., AIPE functionality) should support the creation of distinctly named output files for different iterations to facilitate this.

**9.3. Knowledge Provenance Adherence (Toolkit-Wide)**
    9.3.1.   **REQ-PR-P01: Implementation of Master Plan Ethical Imperative:**
        All Autologos Toolkit applications, especially those generating or processing textual content (AIPE functionality, TFAS, CAT, APR), must be designed and prompted in a way that supports and upholds the ethical imperative for knowledge provenance as defined in the Autaxys Master Plan (Section 7.7).
    9.3.2.   **REQ-PR-P02: Clear Distinction of Sources in Outputs:**
        9.3.2.1.   When an app synthesizes information or generates new text, it must operate under directives that avoid presenting statistically generated text as if it were a direct quotation or fact from an unstated source (aligns with Core Directive Principle 12: Zero Hallucination).
        9.3.2.2.   Outputs intended for AFKB suggestions or draft documents should, where feasible and guided by PI prompts, differentiate between:
            *   Direct extractions/paraphrases from PI-provided citable sources (with hints for citation via TFAS/ARV).
            *   PI's own input ideas or instructions.
            *   "Autologos Synthetic Knowledge" – novel textual configurations generated by the AI based on its training and the immediate context, which require PI validation and intellectual ownership if incorporated.
    9.3.3.   **REQ-PR-P03: Logging Provenance Information:**
        Workflow logs (REQ-AIWO-LP01) and application-specific logs (if any) should contribute to provenance by recording the sources of information used for a given operation (e.g., "AFKB nodes X,Y,Z used as context for AIPE draft generation").
    9.3.4.   **REQ-PR-P04: PI Responsibility for Final Provenance Assertion:**
        The PI remains solely responsible for the final assertion and accurate representation of provenance in all published or archived research outputs, using the toolkit's logs and outputs as aids.

## 10. Roadmap for Autologos Toolkit Development (High-Level)

This section outlines a high-level, phased approach for the iterative development and refinement of the Autologos Toolkit by the Principal Investigator (PI). The prioritization reflects the core needs of the Autaxys research program as defined in the Autaxys Master Plan. This roadmap is indicative and will evolve based on research progress and PI learning in AI Studio development.

            *   Better handling of structured feedback from CAT/APR within refinement cycles.
            *   *SRD Focus:* REQ-AIWO-AIPE-F04.3, F04.4.
    10.2.3.   **Key Milestones for Toolkit:**
        10.2.3.1.   Demonstrable AIWO executing a multi-step workflow (e.g., TFAS analysis -> PI review of summary -> AIPE draft based on summary -> CAT critique of draft -> PI review).
        10.2.3.2.   Functional CAT services providing useful critiques on theoretical texts.
        10.2.3.3.   ARV capable of batch-validating a list of references.

**10.3. Phase 3: Advanced Automation, Exploration & Full Lifecycle Support (Conceptual Long-Term: e.g., Months 24+ of Toolkit Focus)**
    10.3.1.   **Goal:** Mature the AIWO with more complex logic, develop advanced analytical and exploratory capabilities (ABAMPE-like), and fully integrate all QA tools into robust research workflows.

            *   Streamlined (but still PI-validated) workflows for updating AFKB based on toolkit outputs.
    10.3.3.   **Key Milestones for Toolkit:**
        10.3.3.1.   AIWO reliably managing diverse, complex research workflows from initiation to deliverable QA.
        10.3.3.2.   ABAMPE-like functionality demonstrating utility in generating novel, plausible (PI-validated) research leads or conceptual explorations.
        10.3.3.3.   Full suite of CAT and APR services routinely used within research lifecycle.
        10.3.3.4.   Demonstrable end-to-end provenance tracking for a significant research output.

**10.4. Ongoing Evolution:**
    The Autologos Toolkit is expected to evolve continuously. New AI capabilities, changes in the Autaxys Master Plan, or new research challenges identified by the PI will drive further development and refinement of the toolkit and its applications beyond these initial phases.

## 12. Appendix: Illustrative Use Case Scenarios

This appendix provides detailed examples of key research workflows as managed by the Autologos Toolkit, illustrating the interaction between the PI, the AI Workflow Orchestrator (AIWO), constituent applications, and the AFKB. These scenarios are designed to clarify functional requirements and the intended operational experience, emphasizing the toolkit's role as an AI-driven, semi-autonomous "Get It Done" (GTD) system for managing the Autaxys research lifecycle.

**12.1. Use Case Scenario 1: Literature Review & AFKB Synthesis for a New Concept**
    12.1.1.   **Goal:** Process a batch of newly identified research papers relevant to "definitionally emergent relational types" and synthesize their key insights for creating/updating AFKB nodes.
    12.1.2.   **Actors:** PI, AIWO, TFAS, ARV, AIPE-functionality (within AIWO).
    12.1.3.   **Workflow Steps (Conceptual - orchestrated by AIWO):**
        1.  PI initiates "Literature Batch Review" workflow via AIWO, providing a list of PDF files and the focus concept "definitionally emergent relational types."
        2.  AIWO invokes TFAS for each paper:
            *   TFAS extracts text, generates summary, identifies key entities/themes related to the focus concept, extracts bibliographic data, and provides citation hints.
        3.  AIWO presents consolidated TFAS output to PI: summaries, cross-paper themes, list of extracted bibliographic data.
        4.  PI reviews TFAS output, identifies papers for deeper AFKB integration.
        5.  AIWO invokes ARV on extracted bibliographic data for validation. Presents report to PI.
        6.  For selected papers/themes, PI instructs AIWO to use AIPE-functionality with TFAS summaries and original text excerpts (as context) to draft potential new AFKB node content for "Definitionally Emergent Relational Type X" or to elaborate on existing nodes.
        7.  PI reviews AIPE drafts, iterates with AIPE via AIWO for refinement.
        8.  PI validates final content and manually integrates it into the AFKB (Obsidian), creating new notes or updating existing ones with appropriate links and verified citations.
        9.  AIWO logs completion of workflow and links to new/updated AFKB nodes (PI provides links).
    12.1.4.   **Key Requirements Illustrated:** REQ-AIWO-WD01, TM01, AI01, CM01, PI01, ST02; REQ-TFAS-F01-F06; REQ-ARV-F01-F06; REQ-AIWO-AIPE-F01-F08; REQ-PR-L01.

**12.2. Use Case Scenario 2: Drafting and Critiquing a Master Plan Section**
    12.2.1.   **Goal:** Draft a new subsection for the Autaxys Master Plan (e.g., elaborating on a specific Meta-Logical Principle) and subject it to internal critique.
    12.2.2.   **Actors:** PI, AIWO, AIPE-functionality, CAT-services.
    12.2.3.   **Workflow Steps (Conceptual - orchestrated by AIWO):**
        1.  PI initiates "Master Plan Section Drafting" workflow via AIWO, specifying target section number (e.g., 2.4.2.9 New Meta-Logic Elaboration) and providing key bullet points/ideas and references to relevant AFKB nodes.
        2.  AIWO invokes AIPE-functionality with PI's input and AFKB context to generate a first draft of the section.
        3.  AIWO presents draft to PI for initial review and edits. PI provides feedback.
        4.  AIWO re-invokes AIPE-functionality with PI feedback for a revised draft.
        5.  PI approves revised draft for critical analysis.
        6.  AIWO invokes selected CAT services (e.g., Logical Consistency Check, Assumption Identification, Adversarial Critique) on the revised draft.
        7.  AIWO presents CAT analysis report alongside the draft to the PI.
        8.  PI reviews critiques and decides on further revisions (potentially another AIPE cycle) or finalizes the section.
        9.  PI manually integrates the finalized section into the relevant Master Plan Markdown file (e.g., `AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md`).
        10. AIWO logs completion and links to the Master Plan version (PI provides Git commit hash or Zenodo version if applicable).

**12.3. Use Case Scenario 3: Conceptualizing and Drafting an Initial Formal Model (Project 6.2 Focus)**
    12.3.1.   **Goal:** To conceptualize and draft an initial formal model for a specific autaxic dynamic (e.g., "Relational Processing from Undifferentiated Potential"), leveraging AFKB definitions and exploring suitable formalisms.
    12.3.2.   **Actors:** PI, AIWO, AIPE-functionality, TFAS (for formalism literature), CAT-services.
    12.3.3.   **Workflow Steps (Orchestrated by AIWO):**
        1.  **PI Initiates "Formal Model Conceptualization" Workflow:** Specifies target autaxic dynamic (e.g., "Dynamic I: Relational Processing from U"), references relevant Master Plan sections (e.g., 2.4.1.1, 2.5) and AFKB concept nodes.
        2.  **AIWO Task - Literature Scan for Formalisms (TFAS):** AIWO invokes TFAS with keywords (e.g., "process calculi for emergence," "type theory for self-generation," "graph rewriting for relational dynamics") and relevant AFKB context on candidate formalisms (from MP Sec 3.5.4). TFAS synthesizes information on their suitability.
        3.  **PI Review & Formalism Selection:** AIWO presents TFAS synthesis. PI reviews and selects 1-2 candidate formalisms for initial exploration.
        4.  **AIWO Task - Conceptual Mapping (AIPE & CAT):**
            4.1.  PI provides high-level thoughts on how to map the autaxic dynamic to the chosen formalism(s).
            4.2.  AIWO invokes AIPE-functionality to elaborate on these mappings, drawing definitions from AFKB (e.g., "Undifferentiated Potentiality," "Intrinsic Drive," "Distinction," "Relation").
            4.3.  AIWO invokes CAT (Assumption Identification, Logical Consistency) on the AIPE-generated conceptual mapping.
        5.  **PI Review & Refinement of Conceptual Map:** AIWO presents AIPE draft and CAT critique. PI refines the conceptual map.
        6.  **AIWO Task - Initial Formal Sketch Generation (AIPE):** Based on the refined conceptual map and selected formalism, PI instructs AIWO to use AIPE-functionality to generate a pseudo-code or high-level symbolic sketch of the model.
            *   *PI Prompt Example:* "Using [selected formalism, e.g., pi-calculus], sketch a process definition for the 'primordial act of distinction' from 'U' as defined in AFKB nodes [X,Y], driven by 'intrinsic drive' (AFKB node Z)."
        7.  **PI Review & Iteration on Formal Sketch:** AIWO presents the sketch. PI iterates with AIPE via AIWO, refining the formal definitions and process flow.
        8.  **AIWO Task - Documentation of Initial Model:** AIWO uses AIPE to draft an initial documentation stub for the model (linking to AFKB, Master Plan, WBS Project 6.2), including rationale, assumptions, and the formal sketch.
        9.  **PI Validation & AFKB Update Suggestion:** PI validates the documentation. AIWO logs completion and suggests creating a new AFKB artifact for this "v0.1 Formal Model Sketch."

                5.1.1.  AIWO presents the criterion to the PI.
                5.1.2.  PI provides initial thoughts/arguments.
                5.1.3.  AIWO uses AIPE to elaborate on PI's arguments, drawing context from AFKB (e.g., for "Uniqueness," query AFKB for related concepts in other theories).
                5.1.4.  AIWO can invoke CAT (e.g., Adversarial Critique) on PI's justification for a specific criterion to help PI strengthen it.
        6.  **PI Finalizes PEAP Evaluation:** PI reviews all AI-assisted evaluations for each criterion and makes final judgments.
        7.  **AIWO Task - Compile PEAP Record:** AIWO uses AIPE to compile the complete PEAP record, including the final prediction statement, derivation, and PI's detailed evaluation against all criteria.
        8.  **PI Validation & Archiving Preparation:** PI validates the final PEAP record. AIWO formats it for archiving (e.g., Markdown for AFKB, PDF for potential Zenodo submission).
        9.  **AIWO logs completion** and links the PEAP record to relevant Master Plan items and AFKB prediction nodes.
    12.4.4.   **Key Requirements Illustrated:** REQ-AIWO-WD*, TM*, AI*, CM*, PI*, ST*; REQ-AIWO-AIPE-F*; REQ-CAT-FSVC-*; REQ-AFKB-R*, W01, W02; REQ-PR-L01, V*.

        2.  **AIWO Sub-Workflow - Literature Review & Context Gathering (TFAS, ARV, PI):** (Similar to Use Case 12.1) AIWO coordinates TFAS to process relevant background literature (PI-provided or identified via AFKB search), ARV to validate new references. PI curates relevant syntheses and references.
        3.  **AIWO Task - Iterative Section Drafting (AIPE & PI):**
            3.1.  For each section in the PI's outline (Introduction, Methods, Core Autaxys Concepts, Discussion, etc.):
                3.1.1.  AIWO invokes AIPE-functionality with PI's specific points for that section, plus relevant context from AFKB and the literature review synthesis.
                3.1.2.  PI reviews AIPE draft, provides detailed feedback, requests revisions. Multiple AIPE iterations per section.
                3.1.3.  AIWO invokes ARV periodically to check and help format citations within the draft.
        4.  **AIWO Task - Internal Coherence & Argumentation Check (CAT):** Once a full first draft is assembled, AIWO invokes relevant CAT services (Logical Consistency, Assumption ID, Adversarial Critique) across the entire document or on key argument sections.
        5.  **PI Review & Major Revision Cycle (AIPE):** AIWO presents CAT report. PI makes strategic revisions, using AIPE via AIWO for re-drafting.
        6.  **AIWO Task - Simulated Peer Review (APR):** PI selects APR services (e.g., Overall Assessment, Argument Analysis, specific Persona if desired). AIWO invokes APR.
        7.  **PI Review & Final Polish (AIPE):** AIWO presents APR report. PI makes final revisions and polishes the manuscript using AIPE for targeted edits.
        8.  **AIWO Task - Bibliography Generation & Formatting (ARV, AIPE):** AIWO coordinates ARV to compile the final bibliography and AIPE to format the entire paper according to PI-specified (or template-based) style.
        9.  **PI Final Validation:** PI performs final read-through and approves the document.
        10. **AIWO logs completion,** archives final draft and provenance logs.
    12.5.4.   **Key Requirements Illustrated:** Comprehensive use of most AIWO, AIPE, TFAS, ARV, CAT, and APR requirements, demonstrating full lifecycle support from ideation to near-submission output. Strong emphasis on REQ-PR-L01 (logging) and REQ-PR-V* (versioning).

**12.6. Use Case Scenario 6: Updating the Autaxys Master Plan based on New Research Findings**
