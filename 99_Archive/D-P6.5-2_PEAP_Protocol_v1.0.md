### **The PEAP Automation Workflow**

This workflow is triggered whenever a research activity generates a potential predictive claim.

**Step 1: Prediction Identification & Workflow Trigger**
*   A research output (e.g., a formal model from Project 6.2, an analysis from Project 6.7) identifies a new predictive claim.
*   The PI flags this output and issues a command: `AIWO: INITIATE PEAP WORKFLOW`.

**Step 2: Automated Registration (AIPE & AIWO)**
*   The **AIWO** receives the command and activates the **Autologos Iterative Process Engine (AIPE)**.
*   The **AIPE** analyzes the source document and automatically drafts the PEAP registration entry, populating all required fields: Unique ID, Statement, Derivational Strength, Assumptions, and Type.
*   The **AIWO** files this draft entry in the AFKB with a status of "Pending Evaluation."

**Step 3: Automated Evaluation (CAT & AIWO)**
*   The **AIWO** tasks the **Critical Analysis Toolkit (CAT)** to perform the multi-dimensional evaluation of the draft prediction.
*   The **CAT** analyzes the draft against the PEAP criteria (Clarity, Derivational Strength, Testability, Uniqueness, Significance) by cross-referencing it with the entire AFKB, including other theories and data.
*   The **CAT** generates a formal evaluation report, including a score or assessment for each criterion.

**Step 4: PI Review & Approval**
*   The **AIWO** presents the PI with a consolidated review package containing:
    1.  The drafted PEAP Registration Entry.
    2.  The CAT's Evaluation Report.
*   The PI's only task is to review the package and issue a command: `AIWO: APPROVE PEAP [ID]` or `AIWO: REJECT PEAP [ID] WITH REVISIONS [comments]`.

**Step 5: Automated Archiving & Finalization (AIWO)**
*   Upon receiving PI approval, the **AIWO** executes the finalization sequence:
    1.  The prediction's status in the AFKB is changed to "Active."
    2.  A formal, versioned document package is created for public archiving.
    3.  The **AIWO** interfaces with the chosen repository (e.g., Zenodo API) to upload the package and secure a persistent identifier (DOI).
    4.  The DOI and final archived record are logged back into the AFKB.

**Step 6: Dynamic Tracking (AIWO)**
*   The **AIWO** continuously monitors the AFKB. If new data or theoretical revisions that impact an existing prediction are added, the AIWO will automatically flag that prediction for re-evaluation and notify the PI.

This automated workflow is the correct implementation. I will now issue the corrected deliverable document, which replaces the flawed "Governance" section with this superior, system-driven process.

### **1.0 Objective and Scope**

The Prediction Evaluation and Archiving Protocol (PEAP) is a core instrument of the Autaxys Research Methodology (ARM). Its purpose is to instill rigor, transparency, and long-term accountability into the predictive claims arising from the autaxys framework. The PEAP provides a standardized process for registering, evaluating, archiving, and tracking any prediction, from specific empirical hypotheses to more abstract conceptual entailments.

### **2.0 The PEAP Protocol Stages**

The protocol consists of four mandatory stages for every predictive claim, managed by the Autologos Toolkit.

**Stage 1: Prediction Registration**
Every new prediction must be formally registered in the Autaxys Foundational Knowledge Base (AFKB). The registration entry must include:
*   A unique, system-generated Prediction ID.
*   An unambiguous statement of the predictive claim.
*   A detailed account of the prediction's theoretical derivation from core autaxic principles.
*   A clear list of all assumptions and boundary conditions.
*   Classification of the prediction type (e.g., physical, conceptual, etc.).

**Stage 2: Multi-Dimensional Evaluation**
Each registered prediction is subjected to a multi-dimensional evaluation against the following criteria:
*   **Clarity and Precision**
*   **Autaxic Derivational Strength**
*   **Testability/Falsifiability Spectrum** (Empirical, Formal, Conceptual)
*   **Uniqueness and Comparative Strength** (via symmetric scrutiny)
*   **Significance**

**Stage 3: Open Archiving and Versioning**
All approved predictions and their evaluations will be publicly archived with a persistent identifier (DOI), version controlled, and explicitly linked to the AFKB source documents from which they were derived.

**Stage 4: Dynamic Status Tracking and Learning**
The status of each prediction (e.g., "Pending," "Active," "Falsified") is actively tracked. Falsified predictions trigger a mandatory review of the originating theories and models.

### **3.0 Governance and Execution: The PEAP Automation Workflow**

The execution of the PEAP is not the manual responsibility of the PI. It is an **automated workflow managed by the AI Workflow Orchestrator (AIWO)**, a core component of the Autologos Toolkit.

1.  **Initiation:** The PI flags a research output containing a potential prediction, triggering the workflow.
2.  **Automated Drafting:** The **Autologos Iterative Process Engine (AIPE)** drafts the formal PEAP registration entry.
3.  **Automated Evaluation:** The **Critical Analysis Toolkit (CAT)** analyzes the draft and generates a detailed evaluation report against all PEAP criteria.
4.  **PI Review & Approval:** The **AIWO** presents a consolidated package (draft + evaluation) to the PI for a single `APPROVE` or `REJECT` decision.
5.  **Automated Finalization:** Upon approval, the **AIWO** handles all archiving, DOI generation, and final logging in the AFKB.
6.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The **AIWO** monitors the AFKB for new information that may impact the status of any archived prediction, ensuring the PEAP remains a dynamic and responsive system.

This automated process ensures that the PEAP is executed with maximum efficiency, rigor, and consistency, freeing the PI to focus on strategic research and high-level validation.
