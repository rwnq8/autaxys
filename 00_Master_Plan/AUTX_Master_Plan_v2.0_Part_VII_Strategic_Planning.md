**Autaxys Research & Development Master Plan (v2.0)**

**Part VII: Strategic Planning**

**10.0 Phased Research Roadmap**

This section outlines a strategic, phased roadmap for the Autaxys Research & Development Program. Given the foundational nature and ambitious scope of autology, a phased approach allows for iterative development, focused effort on prerequisite tasks, and adaptation based on emerging insights. The phases are indicative and may overlap; **indeed, conceptual development, literature-based groundwork, and preliminary explorations for activities listed in later phases can, and often should, proceed in parallel with the core formalization and modeling efforts of earlier phases.** Progress in one area may accelerate or reshape priorities in others. Within each phase, specific WBS items will be prioritized to ensure critical path progress, especially given the single-PI operational model.

**10.1. Phase 1: Foundational Formalization & Core Model Development**

10.1.1.   **Overarching Goal:** To establish a more rigorous formal (mathematical and/or computational) basis for the core Autaxic Generative Engine (Section 2.4 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and to begin developing initial predictive models for simple emergent phenomena. This phase directly addresses the “Lack of Formalization” identified as a critical weakness (Section 3.4.2 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md), Section 3.7 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)) and is driven by the imperative discussed in Section 3.5 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md). It is also informed by the philosophical considerations in Section 4.1 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md) and 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md) regarding process ontology, intrinsic rationality, and the role of formalization in epistemology.
10.1.2.   **Primary Pillar Focus:** Pillar 5.1 (Foundational Theory & Formalization of Autaxys), as detailed in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Framework_Intro_Pillars.md).
10.1.3.   **Key Projects & Activities (refer to Section 6.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md) for full project details):**

10.4.6.   **Generation of Novel, Testable Hypotheses:** Movement from conceptual predictions to hypotheses with clearer paths to empirical investigation or formal refutation (utilizing PEAP, Section 7.5 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)), particularly those derived from formalized autaxic models.
10.4.7.   **Growth of Interest/Collaboration:** Attraction of other researchers, students, or thinkers to explore, critique, or build upon autaxic ideas.

This roadmap is ambitious and subject to revision as research unfolds. Its primary purpose is to provide a strategic direction and a framework for sustained, focused inquiry into the nature of autaxys.

**11.0 Dissemination, Collaboration, & Community Building**

The advancement of autology from a nascent framework to a robust field of inquiry depends not only on internal research progress but also on effective communication of its ideas, engagement with the broader scientific and philosophical communities, and the cultivation of collaborative efforts. This section outlines specific strategies for disseminating autaxys research, fostering collaborations, and building a community, reflecting a strong commitment to truly Open Access principles, direct engagement, and leveraging specific, suitable platforms and networks. (Managed under Project 6.5, documented in the AFKB, Section 7.8 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).

**11.1. Publication & Dissemination Strategy: Prioritizing Truly Open Access & Specific Platforms**

A multi-pronged strategy will be employed, prioritizing direct, unmediated, and perpetually Open Access dissemination channels, leveraging specific, known platforms:

11.1.1.   **Primary Archiving & Publication Platforms:**
    11.1.1.1.   **Zenodo (zenodo.org):** Continue and expand the use of the existing “Autaxys and Autology” community on Zenodo. This CERN-hosted platform will serve as the principal repository for all research outputs including preprints, working papers, formal publications (monographs, articles), datasets (e.g., from computational models demonstrating ontological closure), software/code (with versioning and DOIs, e.g., formal model code), presentations, and educational materials. (As discussed in Section 7.7.1 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md), Section 12.1, 12.3).
    11.1.1.2.   **QNFO.org:** Consideration will be given to migrating QNFO.org from its current Obsidian Publish platform to a solution like **GitHub Pages** (pages.github.com) to ensure maximum longevity, version control, and potential community contributions to the site’s content. This platform will serve as a central hub linking to all archived materials on Zenodo and OSF, providing narrative context and curated content about autaxys, its principles (intrinsic drive, emergent types, ontological closure), and research progress. (As discussed in Section 12.3).
    11.1.1.3.   **Open Science Framework (OSF - osf.io):** Establish an OSF presence for Autaxys/Autology. OSF will be used for managing active research projects, transparently sharing ongoing work (e.g., “open notebook science” elements for selected projects, including progress notes on formalization or conceptual development), storing supplementary materials, and fostering collaboration on specific research tasks. OSF’s integrations with Zenodo and GitHub will be leveraged. (As discussed in Section 7.7.1 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).

11.1.2.   **Preprint & Working Paper Dissemination:**
    11.1.2.1.   **PhilSci-Archive (philsci-archive.pitt.edu):** Utilize for preprints and working papers focused on the philosophical aspects of autaxys, its methodology, and its implications for philosophy of science, including discussions on the philosophical implications of formalization and ontological closure. This platform is run by and for the philosophy of science community. (As discussed in Section 11.4).
    11.1.2.2.   Zenodo will also serve as a primary preprint server for all autaxys outputs.

11.1.3.   **Engagement with Traditional Venues (Highly Selective & Principled):**
    Given the strong skepticism towards traditional academic gatekeepers and platforms that are not truly Open Access (explicitly avoiding arXiv, ResearchGate, Academia.edu for primary dissemination by the PI), engagement with peer-reviewed journals will be minimal and highly strategic.
    Consideration for such venues will be strictly limited to:
    11.1.3.1.  Journals offering a genuine **Diamond/Platinum Open Access model** (no fees for authors or readers, institutionally supported). The **Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ - doaj.org)** will be consulted to identify such journals.
    11.1.3.2.  Specific journals like **“Philosophy of Physics”** (LSE Press, `philphys.org`) which is fully Open Access and managed by the Philosophy of Physics Society, for philosophical papers on autaxys.
    11.1.3.3.  If a traditional journal is considered for strategic reasons (e.g., reaching a unique, critical audience), it must allow immediate self-archiving of the accepted manuscript (Green OA) on Zenodo/OSF under a CC-BY or similar open license are guaranteed.

**11.2. Strategy for Public & Community Engagement: Specific Platforms & Networks**

Direct engagement with interested individuals, researchers, and the broader public will be focused and strategic:

11.2.1.   **Targeted Social Media & Online Communities:**
    11.2.1.1.   **Mastodon:** Continue and expand active engagement on **mstdn.science** and other relevant academic/scientific Mastodon instances, focusing on substantive discussions, sharing updates from Zenodo/OSF/QNFO.org, and connecting with researchers. Use hashtags relevant to foundational physics, philosophy of science, complexity, etc.
    11.2.1.2.   **Specialized Forums (Cautious Engagement):** Explore participation in highly relevant, moderated forums like **PhysicsOverflow (physicsoverflow.org)** for specific technical Q&A or discussion related to emergent physics or quantum foundations, if the community culture aligns. General forums like Physics Forums or The Philosophy Forum will be lower priority due to noise-to-signal concerns.
    11.2.1.3.   **Other Social Platforms (e.g., Blue Sky):** Limited, experimental use based on observed engagement quality and alignment with open principles. Avoid platforms primarily driven by ephemeral content or pay-to-reach models.

11.2.2.   **Accessible Content Creation & Outreach:**
    11.2.2.1.   Develop accessible summaries, FAQs, and introductory materials about autaxys for diverse audiences, hosted on Zenodo and OSF project pages. These materials should explain core concepts like the intrinsic drive, definitionally emergent relational types, and ontological closure in clear, non-technical language where possible. (As discussed in Section 7.7.2 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).
    11.2.2.2.   Create visual and multimedia content (diagrams, animations, potentially explainer videos or podcasts) to make complex concepts (e.g., the Autaxic Generative Engine, the emergence of patterns, the concept of ontological closure) more accessible. Consider using open standards like **X3D for interactive figures** if feasible.
    11.2.2.3.   Develop a dedicated "Introduction to Autaxys" section on QNFO.org aimed at a general educated audience.

**11.3. Fostering Collaboration & Building a Research Network: Targeted Engagement**

Autology’s interdisciplinary nature necessitates collaboration, built on shared open principles: (Managed under Project 6.5, Section 7.6 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md), documented in the AFKB, Section 7.8 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).

11.3.1.   **Engage with Specific Research Groups & Institutes:**

    11.3.2.6.   Propose and organize small, focused online workshops via QNFO.org/Zenodo/OSF on specific autaxic topics (e.g., "Formalizing Ontological Closure," "Autaxic Perspectives on Emergent Spacetime"), inviting targeted individuals and groups identified through the above engagement strategies.

11.3.3.   **Engage with Key Individuals (through their public work and open platforms):**
    11.3.3.1.   **Prof. Gerard ‘t Hooft:** His work on quantum foundations and alternative interpretations.
    11.3.3.2.   **Prof. Sabina Leonelli (University of Exeter):** Her work on Philosophy of Open Science.
    11.3.3.3.   Individuals identified through the EmerGe collaboration and other listed research groups.
    11.3.3.4.   Researchers whose publications are identified as highly relevant via Project 6.1.

**11.4. Open Access, Open Source, and Open Data Principles (Reiteration with Specifics)**

A steadfast commitment to openness guides all aspects of autaxys research:

11.4.1.   **Truly Open Access Publications:** All primary research outputs (papers, monographs, theses, reports) will be published via **Zenodo** (with CC-BY licenses), mirrored/curated on **QNFO.org**, and potentially preprinted via **PhilSci-Archive** or **OSF Preprints**. This includes publications detailing formal models of autaxic principles (intrinsic drive, emergent types/composition rules, ontological closure) and their applications. (As discussed in Section 7.7.1 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md), Section 11.1, 12.3).
11.4.2.   **Open Source Models & Code:** All computational models, software, and code developed as part of autaxys research (e.g., simulation code for Project 6.2, 6.3, 6.4; code for analyzing formal properties related to ontological closure) will be released under an OSI-approved open-source license (e.g., MIT, GPLv3, Apache 2.0) and made available with thorough documentation via Zenodo and/or public code repositories (e.g., GitHub, linked from OSF and QNFO.org).
11.4.3.   **FAIR Data Sharing:** Datasets generated or used (e.g., simulation results from formal models, processed observational data for comparison) will be managed and shared via Zenodo or OSF according to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). Metadata will include details linking data to the specific autaxic models and principles being tested.
11.4.4.   **Transparent Methodology & Adaptation of “Open Notebook Science” (ONS):** The Autaxys Research Methodology (ARM, Section 7.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)) will be public. The ethos of ‘Open Notebook Science’ (ONS) will be adapted for autaxys research. While the dynamic and extensive nature of Autologos Toolkit-collaborative research (e.g., evolving interactions with multiple applications, context limitations across different platforms) presents challenges for direct, real-time ONS of all interactions, the commitment is to:
    11.4.4.1.   Regularly publish curated ‘intermediate outputs’ (e.g., structured notes, summarized Autologos Toolkit dialogues on specific research tasks, versioned drafts of documents like this Master Plan, decision logs, literature search results from Project 6.1, preliminary formal model sketches) that transparently show the progression of research, methodological choices, and the evolution of ideas, particularly regarding the development of core autaxic concepts and their formalization.
    11.4.4.2.   Utilize platforms like OSF project pages or QNFO.org (potentially with version-controlled repositories via GitHub) to host these intermediate outputs, making the research journey as traceable, examinable, and replicable as practically possible.
    11.4.4.3.   Continuously explore and adopt best practices and tools for effectively archiving and sharing Autologos Toolkit-collaborative research workflows in a manner that upholds the spirit of ONS, ensuring methodological soundness and openness to critique.

By prioritizing these specific, truly open, and community-focused strategies, the autaxys research program aims to foster a transparent, collaborative, rigorous, and evolving intellectual environment, maximizing the reach and impact of its findings.

**12.0 Plan Evolution & Governance**

This Master Research Plan is conceived as a living document, intended to guide a long-term, evolving research program. As such, mechanisms for its review, update, and the governance of the overall autaxys research direction are essential. This section outlines these processes, emphasizing adaptability, responsiveness to new findings, Autologos Toolkit-assisted maintenance, and alignment with the core principles of autology. (Managed under Project 6.5, documented in the AFKB, Section 7.8 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).

**12.1. Process for Reviewing and Updating this Master Plan**

To ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness, this Master Plan will be subject to continuous review and dynamic updates:

12.1.1.   **Continuous, Task-Based Updates (Primary Mode):** The Master Plan will be referred to and updated by the Principal Investigator (PI) in conjunction with ongoing research tasks. As progress is made on specific projects (Section 6.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)), new insights are gained (e.g., from formal modeling in Project 6.2, or from the AFKB in Project 6.1), or priorities shift due to research outcomes (e.g., a prediction is falsified via PEAP), relevant sections of this Plan will be updated in near real-time. This ensures the Plan remains a current reflection of the research’s status and direction. This is balanced with periods of "Focused Research Sprints" on critical WBS items, after which the Autologos Toolkit can assist in batching necessary Plan updates.
12.1.2.   **Periodic Comprehensive Review (e.g., Quarterly or Bi-Annually):** While updates are continuous, a comprehensive review of the entire Master Plan will be conducted by the PI periodically (e.g., every 3-6 months) to assess:
    12.1.2.1.   Overall progress against the Phased Research Roadmap (Section 10.0).
    12.1.2.2.   Strategic alignment and priority of ongoing/planned Research Projects (Section 6.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)), considering new insights about core autaxic principles (intrinsic drive, emergent types, ontological closure) and formalization challenges.
    12.1.2.3.   Effectiveness of the Autaxys Research Methodology (ARM - Section 7.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)) and dissemination strategies (Section 11.0).
    12.1.2.4.   Need for revisions to foundational content ([Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) or philosophical foundations ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)) based on theoretical refinements or formalization progress.
12.1.3.   **Version Control & Archiving:**
    12.1.3.1.   Authoritative versions of this Master Plan (and its constituent files) will be archived and versioned on **Zenodo (zenodo.org)** to ensure long-term, immutable, and citable access. (As discussed in Section 7.7.1 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md), Section 11.1, 12.3).
    12.1.3.2.   Working drafts and intermediate revisions will be managed within the PI's Obsidian vault, potentially synced with a private GitHub repository for backup and versioning, with definitive versions regularly committed to Zenodo.
12.1.4.   **Autologos Toolkit-Assisted Updates & Maintenance:** This Master Plan is designed to be maintained and evolved via collaboration with the Autologos Toolkit (Section 8.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md)). The process involves:
    12.1.4.1.   The PI providing the latest version of the Plan (or relevant segment) to an appropriate Autologos application (e.g., "Autologos Iterative Process Engine").
    12.1.4.2.   The PI providing new information, status updates, `EVOLVE` suggestions, or directives for revision.
    12.1.4.3.   The Autologos application generating updated sections or a revised full draft, which is then subject to the PI’s review and the established QA process (as per Autologos Core Directives, Section 8.4 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md)). The Toolkit assists in ensuring internal consistency across sections, particularly when updates to foundational concepts (like ontological closure or emergent types) impact other parts of the plan.
12.1.5.   **Input for Review & Updates:** The review and update process will consider:
    12.1.5.1.   Outputs and learnings from completed research projects, especially formalization results (Project 6.2) and prediction evaluations (PEAP).
    12.1.5.2.   Feedback received from the broader community (via QNFO.org, Zenodo discussions, collaborations, etc.).
    12.1.5.3.   Relevant advancements in external fields (physics, philosophy, complexity science, etc.) identified via Project 6.1 (utilizing the AFKB).
    12.1.5.4.   New `EVOLVE` suggestions from the PI or future collaborators.

**12.2. Mechanism for Incorporating New Research Findings and `EVOLVE` Suggestions**

A core aspect of this Plan’s dynamism is its capacity to incorporate new knowledge and adapt its direction:

12.2.1.   **Integration of Research Findings:** Results from completed projects (Section 6.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)) will be systematically evaluated for their impact on:
    12.2.1.1.   Core autaxic theory (potentially leading to revisions in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), including refinements to the understanding of intrinsic drive, emergent types/composition rules, and ontological closure based on formal modeling or conceptual analysis.
    12.2.1.2.   The status of Open Questions (Section 3.7 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)).
    12.2.1.3.   The viability and direction of other ongoing or planned projects.
    12.2.1.4.   The Autaxys Ultimate Reality Framework Examination responses (Section 3.2 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)), if findings necessitate updates to autaxys’ stance on fundamental questions.
    12.2.1.5.   The philosophical implications of the framework ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).
    12.2.1.6.   The understanding of the Autologos Toolkit as a reflective system (Section 8.8 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md)).
12.2.2.   **Processing `EVOLVE` Suggestions:** Suggestions for evolving the autaxys framework or this Master Plan itself (whether from the PI’s reflections or from external contributors, as per Autologos Core Directives *Principle 17* and Section 8.2.3.5 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md)) will be logged (potentially via an Autologos app or within the AFKB) and systematically reviewed during the periodic comprehensive reviews (or more frequently if a suggestion is of high immediate impact). Suggestions related to formalization approaches, new potential predictions, or methodological improvements will be prioritized.
12.2.3.   **Pathways for Substantive Plan Revision:** If new findings or compelling `EVOLVE` suggestions indicate a need for significant changes to Research Pillars (Section 5.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Framework_Intro_Pillars.md)), the core ARM (Section 7.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)), the overall Roadmap (Section 10.0), or the philosophical foundations ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)), these will be addressed during a comprehensive review and incorporated into a new version of the Master Plan, archived on Zenodo.

**12.3. Long-term Stewardship of Autaxys Research**

While initially PI-driven, the long-term vision for autaxys research involves fostering a broader community. Stewardship considerations include:

12.3.1.   **Principal Investigator Responsibility:** Initially, the PI (Rowan Brad Quni) holds primary responsibility for maintaining this Master Plan, guiding the research program, and upholding the core principles of autology, including the commitment to Open Science and the integrity of the Autologos Toolkit-assisted process.
12.3.2.   **Development of QNFO.org & Zenodo Community:** These platforms will serve as key infrastructure for long-term knowledge preservation, dissemination, and community interaction, designed for resilience (e.g., Zenodo’s CERN backing, potential GitHub Pages migration for QNFO.org). They will host all versions of the Master Plan, research outputs, and potentially community discussion forums. (As discussed in Section 11.1, 12.1).
12.3.3.   **Cultivating a Collaborative Community:** As collaborators become more involved (Section 11.3), mechanisms for shared discussion about research priorities and plan evolution will be explored (e.g., dedicated forums on QNFO.org, collaborative workshops, shared repositories for specific projects). The ARM (Section 7.0 in [Part V: Research Framework](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)) provides guidelines for integrating contributions from diverse backgrounds.
12.3.4.   **Succession Planning (Very Long-Term):** In the very long term, if a sustainable research community emerges, formalizing governance structures for autology (e.g., a small advisory board, editorial guidelines for community platforms, protocols for updating core documents like the Master Plan and Autologos Core Directives) might be considered to ensure the continuity and integrity of the research program beyond the PI’s direct involvement. This is a distant consideration but noted as part of responsible long-term stewardship.
12.3.5.   **Commitment to Openness:** The enduring commitment to Open Access, Open Source, and transparent methodology (Section 11.4) is itself a core component of long-term stewardship, ensuring the work remains accessible, verifiable, and buildable-upon by future generations.

This framework for plan evolution and governance aims to ensure that the Autaxys Research & Development Program remains dynamic, responsive, and sustainable over the long term.
