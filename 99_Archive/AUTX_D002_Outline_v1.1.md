  title: "Autaxys and Autology: Definition, Rationale, and Implications"

    - section_id: "1.0"
      title: "Introduction: Imperative for New Foundational Terminology" # Revised
      objective: "Establish the context and necessity for introducing 'autaxys' and 'autology' within a framework aiming to reinterpret reality based on self-generating patterns."
      key_points:
        - "Brief overview of limitations of current paradigms (materialism, naive realism) in fully explaining reality (linking to D001/D005 themes)."
        - "Challenge of using existing terms like 'information' due to prevalent connotations (e.g., Shannon entropy, data transmission) that don't capture intended ontological depth."
        - "Goal of Project AUTX ('Autaxys: A Framework for Pattern-Based Reality') and role of precise terminology."
        - "Introduction of 'autaxys' as proposed fundamental principle and 'autology' as its field of study."
        - "Purpose and structure of this foundational document."

    - section_id: "2.0"
      title: "Etymology and Conceptual Lineage: Crafting 'Autaxys' and 'Autology'" # Maintained Title Case for Autaxys/Autology here as they are the subject
      objective: "Detail linguistic roots and conceptual motivations behind choice of 'autaxys' and 'autology'."
      key_points:
        - "Detailed etymological breakdown of 'autaxys':"
          - "Auto- (αὐτός - autos): self, spontaneous, intrinsic."
          - "Taxis (τάξις - taxis): arrangement, order, system, due classification."
          - "Combined meaning: self-ordering, self-arranging, self-generating system."
        - "Detailed etymological breakdown of 'autology':"
          - "Auto- (referring to autaxys as subject) + -logy (λογία - study of)."
          - "Meaning: Study of autaxys."
        - "Rationale for neologisms:"
          - "Addressing limitations of 'information', classical *logos*."
          - "Need for terms that are relatively unique, academically sound, and conceptually resonant."
