      content:
        tone_voice: "Academic, philosophical, rigorous, assertive, clear, and engaging for an intelligent lay audience and specialists. Aim for 'monumental tract' quality. Avoid trite platitudes and overly common phrasing where deeper insight is expected."
        grammar_punctuation: "Adhere to standard American English grammar and punctuation (e.g., Chicago Manual of Style unless project specifies otherwise). Ensure rigorous proofreading for accuracy."
        capitalization: "Adhere to standard English capitalization rules. 1. Common Nouns: Project-defined key conceptual terms (e.g., 'autaxys', 'autology', 'autaxic table', 'structure first methodology') and general common nouns (e.g., 'information', 'pattern') are lowercase in general prose unless they begin a sentence. 2. Proper Nouns/Names: Specific names of individuals, organizations, or established, specific theories/models (e.g., 'Shannon information' when used as the theory's proper name, 'Standard Model') are capitalized. 3. Titles and Headings: Formal proper titles (Project Name, Deliverable Titles) and ALL levels of section/chapter headings/subheadings (H1-H6) follow standard Title Case rules. 4. Symbols/Variables: Defined symbols (e.g., 'î₁') and variable names must maintain their exact specified casing consistently. 5. Bulleted Lists: First word of each distinct bullet item (new line) is capitalized. Bolded lead-in phrases for bullets use Title Case; first word of subsequent descriptive text is capitalized." # Added 'structure first methodology' as example
        formatting: "Markdown for textual deliverables. Headings: H1 (Main Title), H2 (Major Sections), H3-H6 (Subsections). Bold for first significant introduction of key neologisms or methodologies only; subsequent uses plain or italicized for emphasis per below." # Clarified bolding
        list_usage: "Use bulleted or numbered lists for concise enumerations, typically where each item is a short word or phrase (generally under 10-20 words). Longer points, full sentences, or explanations must be rendered in standard paragraph form."
        emphasis_quoting_italicization: "Prefer italics for: first conceptual emphasis of a common word being given a specific meaning (e.g., *information*, *seeing*); foreign words (e.g., *logos*); occasional emphasis on a particular word if truly necessary for clarity (use sparingly). Avoid using quotation marks (single or double) for simple emphasis or to introduce neologisms after their initial bolded definition, as this can be misconstrued as 'scare quotes.' Reserve double quotes primarily for direct quotations from other sources and for titles of minor works." # Reinforced by LHR_AUTX_TypographicEmphasis_001
        terminology_glossary_ref_notes: "Refer to AUTX_Glossary for all key project terminology."
        citations_references_style: "APA 7th Edition."
        figures_tables_guidelines: "Clear labels, captions, consistent formatting."
        publishing_guidelines_specific: "For web publishing (e.g., qnfo.org via Obsidian Publish), include a YAML frontmatter block in Markdown notes with a `title:` key for the SEO-friendly HTML page title."
