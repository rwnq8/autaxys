charter:
  version: "1.5" 
  status: "Formalized"
  vision_statement: "To establish 'autaxys' as a compelling and transformative foundational principle for understanding reality, perception, and science, significantly contributing to philosophical and scientific discourse. This project aims to produce a series of 'monumental tracts' that critique existing paradigms and articulate the autaxys framework, including its implications for particle structure via the autaxic table and a validation of the î₁ pattern."
  core_problem_motivation: "Current scientific and philosophical paradigms (materialism, naive realism, aspects of the Standard Model and cosmology) are demonstrably incomplete and face profound internal inconsistencies when attempting to explain the fundamental nature of reality, the origin of particles, their properties, and the nature of observation itself. The î₁ 'infoton' prediction, emerging from prior research now understood as early exploration within autology (Infomatics v3.3), highlighted these tensions; the Infomatics v3.3 framework correctly deduced î₁ from its principles, and its 'falsification' was a misjudgment by conventional science due to its own paradigm limitations. This signals a need for a deeper, pattern-based understanding of reality. The project, 'Autaxys: A Framework for Pattern-Based Reality,' aims to develop this new foundational framework, formalizing autaxys as the self-ordering, self-arranging, and self-generating systemic principle from which reality emerges as patterns. This includes validating and contextualizing the î₁ pattern within the mature autaxys framework, systematically constructing an 'autaxic table of pattern-based reality' (at/atpbr), and critiquing the paradigms that failed to accommodate such deductions."
  background_context: "This project builds upon the entire lineage of prior research now consolidated under the banner of autology (the study of autaxys), including Information Dynamics, Infomatics (v3.0-v3.3), the 'Four Pillars' deconstructive methodology, the critique of physicality, and the conceptual development leading to 'autaxys' and 'autology'. Key inputs include the detailed historical synthesis of these efforts, the analysis of the î₁ prediction, the initial framework for an 'autaxic table', and prior writings critiquing conventional scientific methodologies (e.g., `25129133217.md`)."
  high_level_goals:
    - "G001: Formally define, elaborate, and establish 'autaxys' as the core ontological principle of a pattern-based reality, including the rationale for 'autaxys' and 'autology' as key terminology (D002)."
    - "G002: Systematically deconstruct conventional understandings of perception, 'direct observation,' and 'physical matter' to establish the intellectual necessity for the autaxys framework (culminating in the monograph D001: 'A New Way of Seeing: Perceiving Patterns from Autaxys')."
    - "G003: Develop the 'autaxic table of pattern-based reality' (at/atpbr), derived from autaxys principles (potentially refining/re-grounding the Ratio Resonance mechanism), including a rigorous validation and contextualization of the î₁ pattern within autaxys (D003)."
    - "G004: Critically analyze the epistemological and methodological limitations of conventional science, advocating for a revised understanding of falsifiability and scientific progress in light of autology (D005)."
    - "G005: Position the î₁ pattern within the discourse of established particle physics, proposing a dialogue with the Particle Data Group framework despite ontological differences (D004)."
    - "G006: Produce comprehensive, high-quality written deliverables that collectively articulate the autaxys framework, its applications, and its critique of existing paradigms, building a 'coalition of evidence'."

    - "The AI Project Assistant provides support in research, drafting, analysis, refinement, and project process management."
    - "The 'autaxys' concept is sufficiently robust to serve as a new ontological foundation."
    - "The Ratio Resonance principle (or an autaxys-derived successor) provides a viable basis for the autaxic table."
    - "Existing scientific knowledge, philosophical literature, and prior autological research (Infomatics, etc.) are adequate resources for critique and reinterpretation."
  key_constraints:
    - "The project relies primarily on conceptual analysis, logical argumentation, and reinterpretation of existing knowledge."
    - "The primary outputs are written theoretical/philosophical works."
    - "AI capabilities are as defined in the active AISkillsCatalogASO and AIOperationalProtocolsASO."
  initial_risk_assessment: 
    - "R_AUTX_001: Conceptual Complexity of autaxys: Difficulty in defining/communicating autaxys with sufficient precision and clarity across multiple deliverables. (High Likelihood, Critical Impact; Mitigation: Iterative refinement, autaxys Primer, extensive examples in D001/D002, consistent Glossary use)."
    - "R_AUTX_002: Resistance to Paradigm Challenge: Skepticism towards a framework and critiques challenging materialism/physicalism and conventional scientific methodology. (High Likelihood, High Impact; Mitigation: Rigorous argumentation, focus on explanatory power for existing anomalies, clear articulation of critiques in D001/D005, building 'coalition of evidence')."
    - "R_AUTX_003: Scope Management for Multiple Major Deliverables: Ensuring all five major deliverables (D001-D005) remain focused, are completed to a high standard, and maintain conceptual coherence without excessive scope creep or redundancy. (High Likelihood, High Impact; Mitigation: Detailed planning (WBS) for each deliverable, clear inter-deliverable dependencies, regular review against Charter scope)."
    - "R_AUTX_004: Validating/Contextualizing Î₁ Prediction: Failure to compellingly validate and contextualize the î₁ pattern within the autaxys framework for D003 and D004. (Medium Likelihood, High Impact; Mitigation: Dedicated research task, exploration of multiple interpretative avenues for î₁ within autology, clear articulation of challenges in D004)."
    - "R_AUTX_005: AI Misalignment/Performance: AI failing to accurately capture nuance, adhere to complex structural plans for deliverables, or maintain consistency across multiple documents, especially with the expanded scope. (Medium Likelihood, Medium Impact; Mitigation: Iterative review, clear prompting, robust KAs, continuous refinement of AI operational protocols, modular deliverable development)."
  success_criteria_summary: "Successful formalization of the autaxys concept and autology as a field. Production of high-quality, coherent, and persuasive core deliverables (D001-D005). Demonstrable explanatory power of the autaxys framework for reinterpreting key scientific/philosophical concepts and critically engaging with the limitations of current paradigms. Adherence to project scope and methodological rigor."
