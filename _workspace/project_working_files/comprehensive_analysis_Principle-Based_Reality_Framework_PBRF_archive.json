      "summary": "This document, *Implied Discretization and the Limits of Modeling Continuous Reality*, analyzes the fundamental problem of using finite-precision digital computation to model potentially continuous physical reality. It introduces 'implied discretization' as the unavoidable imposition of granularity due to finite computational tools, distinct from explicit modeling choices. The text argues this is more than a technical issue, posing significant methodological and epistemological challenges, especially for sensitive systems like chaos or complex models like AI. It reviews technical effects like error propagation and numerical artifacts, discusses alternative computational paradigms, and explores connections to foundational limits like the Church-Turing Thesis and Gödelian concepts. The conclusion synthesizes that implied discretization is both a technical challenge manageable with rigorous V&V and a signpost towards fundamental limits related to chaos, infinity, and computability. It stresses the need for vigilance and robust methodology in computationally intensive research.",

The primer details essential mitigation strategies, such as convergence testing, precision comparison, method comparison, and focusing on robust qualitative features. It emphasizes that rigorous application of these methods is crucial for ensuring simulation results reflect the intended IO/CEE framework dynamics rather than numerical errors.

The assessment checks if concepts are defined using only Layer 0 principles, if plausible qualitative mechanisms are derived, and if the framework withstands internal consistency and adversarial checks. The conclusion is that the Layer 1 framework successfully meets these criteria and is validated for the next step.",

      "summary": "This document evaluates Network-Based Models as a potential formalism for PBRF Layer 2. It assesses their suitability against defined requirements (REQ-L2-01 to REQ-L2-07), drawing on descriptions from *Mathematical Models of Pattern Formation*. The evaluation finds strong alignment, particularly with the principles of Contextuality and Relationality (P5), due to the explicit representation of nodes and edges. Network models are seen as flexible, capable of representing events, sequence, locality, pattern formation, and emergence. Challenges include defining specific rules from L0/L1, computational complexity, and ensuring conservation. The document concludes that Network-Based Models are a very strong candidate, potentially favored over standard Cellular Automata, and recommends retaining them for further comparison.",

Building on the evaluation of v0.1, it specifies state variables (scalar real values for state S and persistence P, non-negative scalar for edge weight w) and proposes concrete functional forms for the state and persistence update rules. The state update is based on local flow dynamics of a conserved quantity Q, directly linking S to conservation. Persistence P evolves based on state stability. The proposal addresses conservation via flow and suggests initial ideas for context representation (shared neighbors). Topology dynamics are deferred. The document concludes by outlining the next step: evaluating this v0.2 proposal.",

      "summary": "This document presents version 0.4 of the PBRF Layer 2 Network-Based Model (NBM), specifically the Dynamic Causal Influence Network (DCIN). It refines the model based on insights from v0.3 simulation results (*0234_PBRF_L2_NBM_v0.3_Initial_Sim_Results*). Key changes include modifying how persistence influences dynamics, shifting from potential enhancement to modulating effective conductance (resistance to flow), and providing a concrete definition for the context mechanism. The document details the refined state variables and update rules, discusses how v0.4 embodies PBRF principles, and outlines remaining issues and next steps, including planning further simulations (*0236_PBRF_L2_NBM_v0.4_Initial_Sim_Plan*).",
