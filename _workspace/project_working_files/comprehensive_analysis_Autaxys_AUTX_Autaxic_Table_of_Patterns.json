      "summary": "This document introduces the *Autaxic Table of Patterns* as a *Unified Generative Framework* for fundamental physics. It posits that reality emerges from the dynamic interaction of fundamental Distinctions (D) and Relations (R), possessing intrinsic Proto-properties. The core principle is *Ontological Closure* (OC), which acts as a cosmic filter, allowing only stable, self-consistent relational patterns to persist. Physical properties are derived characteristics of these patterns, classified by *Autaxic Quantum Numbers* (AQNs). The universe is viewed as a self-organizing relational computation governed by a *Cosmic Algorithm*, potentially influenced by principles like *Relational Aesthetics* and an *Economy of Existence*. The framework aims to provide a generative explanation for mass, energy, forces, spacetime, and the particle spectrum, contrasting with existing models like the *Standard Model* and *String Theory* by deriving entities from rules rather than positing them as fundamental inputs. It also speculates on the nature of Proto-Qualia and Algorithmic Self-Modification.",
