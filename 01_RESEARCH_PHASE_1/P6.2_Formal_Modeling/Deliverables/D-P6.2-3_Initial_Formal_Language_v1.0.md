### **1.0 Objective**

The purpose of this document is to define a clear, consistent, and unambiguous formal notation for the core concepts used in the initial modeling of the Autaxic Generative Engine. This notation, established in Project 6.2, will serve as the foundation for all subsequent formal descriptions and computational models in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the research program.

### **2.0 Core Concepts and Notation**

The following defines the foundational elements of the formal language.

| Concept | Symbol | Definition | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Distinction** | `d` | A fundamental, unique entity or node within a pattern. Subscripts are used for specific instances. | `d_1`, `d_2` |
| **Relational Pattern** | `G` | A set of distinctions and the relations between them, represented as a directed graph. | `G = (V, E)` |
| **Set of Distinctions** | `V(G)` | The set of all distinctions (nodes) within a pattern `G`. | `V(G) = {d_1, d_2, d_3}` |
| **Asymmetric Link** | `r(d_i, d_j)` | A directed, non-reciprocal relation from `d_i` to `d_j`. Represented as a directed edge. | `r(d_1, d_2)` |
| **Set of Links** | `E(G)` | The set of all asymmetric links (edges) within a pattern `G`. | `E(G) = {r(d_1, d_2), r(d_2, d_3)}` |
| **Self-Application** | `f(G)` | The transformation function that applies a pattern's own relational logic to itself. It generates a new pattern `G'` that includes all implied relations. | `G' = f(G)` |
| **Ontological Closure** | `G' = G` | The condition for coherence and stability. A pattern is coherent if and only if applying the self-application function `f(G)` results in no change to the pattern's structure. | `is_coherent(G) ⇔ f(G) = G` |

### **3.0 Example of Usage in the P6.2 Prototype**

The notation is applied to the core experiment as follows:

1.  **Define two stable patterns, P1 and P2:**
    *   `P1` has `V(P1) = {d_1, d_2}` and `E(P1) = {r(d_1, d_2)}`.
    *   `P2` has `V(P2) = {d_2, d_3}` and `E(P2) = {r(d_2, d_3)}`.

2.  **Compose them to create the non-transitive graph, `G_composite`:**
    *   `G_composite` has `V(G_composite) = {d_1, d_2, d_3}`.
    *   `G_composite` has `E(G_composite) = {r(d_1, d_2), r(d_2, d_3)}`.

3.  **Check for coherence by applying the `f(G)` transformation:**
    *   The function `f(G)` detects the path `r(d_1, d_2)` followed by `r(d_2, d_3)`.
    *   It determines that the implied relation `r(d_1, d_3)` is missing from `E(G_composite)`.
    *   Therefore, `f(G_composite) ≠ G_composite`, and the pattern is **not coherent**.

4.  **Create the transitively closed graph, `G_closed`:**
    *   `G_closed = f(G_composite)`.
    *   `E(G_closed) = {r(d_1, d_2), r(d_2, d_3), r(d_1, d_3)}`.

5.  **Check the new graph for coherence:**
    *   Applying `f(G_closed)` finds no new implied relations.
    *   Therefore, `f(G_closed) = G_closed`, and the pattern is **coherent**.

### **4.0 Scope and Future Evolution**

This notation is foundational and intentionally minimal. It is sufficient for the modeling conducted in Phase 1. Future research projects, particularly those in Phase 2 and 3 (e.g., P6.3, P6.4), will require this language to be extended to include concepts such as:

*   Relation types and weights.
*   Temporal indices for dynamic evolution.
*   Higher-order relations (relations acting on other relations).

Any extensions will be formally documented in subsequent versions of this language specification.

### **5.0 Conclusion**

A clear, simple, and sufficient formal language has been established for the initial phase of the Autaxys research program. This notation ensures that all formal work is communicated unambiguously, forming a solid foundation for future theoretical and computational development.
