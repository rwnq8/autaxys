**Autaxys Research & Development Master Plan (v2.0)**

**Part V: Research Framework**

This part outlines the overarching research themes (Pillars 5.1-5.5) and specific, actionable Research Projects (Section 6.0, detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)) designed to systematically investigate, develop, formalize, and explore the implications of autaxys. It also details the Autaxys Research Methodology (ARM, Section 7.0, detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)) and the Autologos Protocol (Section 8.0, detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md)) that guide this research.

**5.0 Overarching Research Themes & Pillars for Autaxys Development**

The development of autaxys from a foundational conceptual framework into a mature scientific and philosophical paradigm requires a focused, yet comprehensive, research strategy. This section outlines the overarching strategic research themes, reframed here as “Research Pillars,” that will guide the specific projects detailed in Section 6.0 (in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)). These Pillars are derived from the key areas of inquiry identified in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) and [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md), including the open questions (Section 3.7 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)), the Autaxys Ultimate Reality Framework Examination responses (Section 3.2 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)), the unique contributions of autaxys (Section 3.4.3 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)), and the philosophical implications ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)). They also build upon the thematic organization of novel predictions explored in prior work (Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)). (Documented in the AFKB, Section 7.8 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).

The aim is to create a structure that is both broad enough to encompass the full potential of autaxys and focused enough to guide concrete research efforts. Each Pillar represents a major domain of investigation critical for the advancement of autology.

**5.1. Pillar A: Foundational Theory & Formalization of Autaxys**
5.1.1.   **Strategic Intent:** This pillar constitutes the bedrock of the autaxys research program. Its strategic intent is to develop, refine, and formalize the core theoretical structure of autaxys, moving beyond conceptual articulation towards a rigorous, predictive framework. This involves a deep investigation into the fundamental nature of autaxys, its intrinsic dynamics, and its *meta-logical principles*. This pillar directly addresses the "Lack of Formalization" identified as a critical weakness (Section 3.7 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)) and is driven by the imperative discussed in Section 3.5 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md). It is also informed by the philosophical considerations in Section 4.1 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md) and 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md) regarding process ontology, intrinsic rationality, and the role of formalization in epistemology.
5.1.2.   **Key Focus Areas:**
    5.1.2.1.   **Formalizing the Autaxic Generative Engine:** This involves translating the conceptual principles of the Autaxic Generative Engine (Section 2.4 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md))—including its *Core Operational Dynamics* (e.g., *Relational Processing*, *Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking*, *Feedback Dynamics*, *Resonance*, *Critical State Transitions*) and *Intrinsic Meta-Logical Principles* (e.g., *Intrinsic Coherence*, *Conservation of Distinguishability*, *Parsimony*, *Intrinsic Determinacy*, *Interactive Complexity Maximization*)—into precise mathematical and computational models. This is the primary objective of Project 6.2 (detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)). This includes formalizing the concept of undifferentiated potential (Section 2.5.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), the intrinsic drive (Section 2.5.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), the primordial act (Section 2.5.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), the definitionally emergent relational types and their composition rules (Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), and the intrinsic enforcement mechanisms of coherence as ontological constraints rooted in self-constitution (ontological closure, including internal consistency, compositional coherence, and formal self-referential stability via stable fixed points) criteria (as discussed in Section 2.5 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) and Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), A1_ConceptualPaper_RelationalProcessing_IntrinsicCoherence_V20 - see `01_Foundational_Documents/Other_Core_Conceptual_Papers/`).
    5.1.2.2.   **Refining Core Autaxic Concepts:** Continuously refining the definitions and interrelations of fundamental autaxic concepts (Section 2.1, 2.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) to ensure clarity, precision, and consistency as the formalization efforts progress, incorporating insights gained from formal modeling regarding concepts like intrinsic drive, emergent types/composition rules, and ontological closure, and reflecting the philosophical implications discussed in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md).
    5.1.2.3.   **Exploring Novel Formalisms:** Investigating and, if necessary, developing new mathematical and computational formalisms that are uniquely suited to capture the self-generating, processual, and intrinsically ordered nature of autaxys, addressing the unique challenges outlined in Section 3.5.2 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md) and guided by the philosophical considerations in Section 3.5.3 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md). This includes exploring hybrid formalisms or *meta-formalisms* (as discussed conceptually in Chapter 15 of *A New Way of Seeing*) and considering an ensemble approach (as discussed in Section 3.5.4 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md), A1_ConceptualPaper_RelationalProcessing_IntrinsicCoherence_V20, Section 7.2).
    5.1.2.4.   **Establishing Foundational Consistency:** Rigorously testing the internal logical consistency of the autaxys framework and its derived models, ensuring that its principles do not lead to contradictions, particularly focusing on the consistency of the formalized intrinsic meta-logical principles and their interplay with the dynamics, and verifying that the formalized criteria for ontological closure successfully prevent internal contradictions. This aligns with the epistemological goal of articulating intrinsic rationality (Section 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).

The work within Pillar 5.1 is continuously informed by the synthesized knowledge from internal foundational works (outputs of Project 6.1, detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)) and external interdisciplinary literature (Section 7.6 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)), all housed within the AFKB (Section 7.8 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)). The Autologos Toolkit (Section 8.0 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md)) assists in the systematic management of this knowledge within the AFKB and in the iterative drafting and refinement of formal models and conceptual definitions.

**5.2. Pillar B: Autaxic Cosmology & Emergent Physics**
5.2.1.   **Strategic Intent:** This pillar aims to apply the **autaxys** framework to fundamental questions in cosmology and physics, seeking to explain the ultimate origin and nature of spacetime, matter, energy, and physical laws as emergent phenomena from the **Autaxic Generative Engine** (Section 2.4 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)). It challenges conventional axiomatic approaches by providing a deeper, generative account for the universe’s observed structure and dynamics (as discussed in Chapter 14 of *A New Way of Seeing*). This pillar is deeply connected to the metaphysical foundations of autaxys ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md), Section 4.1), particularly the process-pattern ontology (Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), the acausal origin (Section 2.5 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), and the emergence of fundamental structures (Section 2.7 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)).

5.2.2.   **Key Focus Areas:**
    5.2.2.1.   **Emergence of Spacetime:** Investigating how spacetime (Section 2.7.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), including its dimensionality and geometric properties, emerges as a relational structure from the continuous *Relational Processing* (Dynamic I, Section 2.4.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) of autaxys, utilizing definitionally emergent relational types (e.g., causal relations, Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and their composition rules, constrained by ontological closure (Section 2.5 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Chapter 12 of *A New Way of Seeing*, Project 6.3 detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)). This directly applies the metaphysical claim of spacetime as emergent (Section 4.1.4 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)). (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how spacetime is understood as a pattern).
    5.2.2.2.   **Origin of Matter and Energy:** Explaining how what is perceived as fundamental particles, fields, and energy arises as stable, complex patterns (Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) generated by the **Autaxic Generative Engine** (Section 2.4 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), particularly through *Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking* (Dynamic II, Section 2.4.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Section 2.4.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) cascades and *Resonance* (Dynamic IV, Section 2.4.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), utilizing definitionally emergent relational types and their composition rules (Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Chapter 11, 13 of *A New Way of Seeing*). This involves reinterpreting particle properties and interactions within an autaxic context (Chapter 11) and linking them to the requirements for self-constitution (ontological closure, including formal self-referential stability via stable fixed points, Section 2.6.2.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)). This grounds the nature of perceived "substances" in underlying process and pattern (Section 4.1.1 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)). (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for detailed exposition of Autaxic Patterns).
    5.2.2.3.   **Derivation of Physical Laws and Constants:** Seeking to derive the observed physical laws and fundamental constants of the universe as emergent regularities (Section 2.7.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and self-tuned parameters of autaxys’ intrinsic dynamics (originating from the intrinsic drive, Section 2.5.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and *meta-logical principles* (e.g., *Intrinsic Coherence* as ontological closure, *Parsimony*, Section 2.4.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), particularly how these laws and constants are constrained by the criteria for ontological closure (including internal consistency, compositional coherence, and formal self-referential stability via stable fixed points, Section 2.6.2.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and the properties of definitionally emergent relational types and their composition rules (Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Chapter 10 of *A New Way of Seeing*). This addresses the “fine-tuning” problem by positing an internal self-organization mechanism (Chapter 8) and aligns with the metaphysical claim of intrinsic order (Section 4.1.3 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).
    5.2.2.4.   **Autaxic Explanations for Cosmological Phenomena:** Developing autaxic models to account for large-scale cosmic structures (Section 2.7.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), the universe’s evolution (from the intrinsic drive), and phenomena such as dark matter and dark energy, reinterpreting them as manifestations of autaxys’ dynamics (including the intrinsic drive and emergent types/composition rules) rather than unknown substances (Chapter 14, Project 6.3 detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)). This leverages the explanatory power for "dark sector" anomalies (Section 3.4.1 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)). (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how cosmic structures are patterns).
    5.2.2.5.   **Re-evaluation of Quantum Foundations:** Applying autaxys to re-examine the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics, including wave-particle duality and the measurement problem, by framing them as expressions of autaxys’ underlying potentialities and interaction rules (based on definitionally emergent relational types and their composition rules, Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and the constraints of intrinsic coherence (ontological closure, including formal self-referential stability, Section 2.6.2.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) (Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Chapter 11). This connects to the metaphysical view of particles as process-patterns and the epistemological challenge of understanding quantum reality (Section 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).

The research within Pillar 5.2 requires rigorous engagement with existing cosmological and physics theories, drawing upon the synthesized knowledge from internal foundational works (outputs of Project 6.1) and external interdisciplinary literature (Section 7.6 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)), all housed in the AFKB (Section 7.8 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)). The Autologos Toolkit (Section 8.0 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Autologos_Protocol.md)) assists in managing this complex knowledge base and in the iterative drafting and refinement of theoretical models and comparative analyses.

**5.3. Pillar C: Autaxys, Complexity, and Emergent Phenomena (including Life & Consciousness)**
5.3.1.   **Strategic Intent:** This pillar investigates the capacity of **autaxys** to generate and explain complex emergent phenomena across different scales, with a particular focus on the principles underlying the emergence of life and consciousness. This pillar directly engages with the metaphysical claims regarding the emergence of complexity ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md), Section 4.1.4) and the naturalistic grounding for mind/consciousness (Section 3.4.1 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md), Section 4.4 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)), and is informed by the epistemological considerations of integrating third-person and first-person inquiry (Section 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md), Section 7.1 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)). (Documented in the AFKB, Section 7.8 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).

5.3.2.   **Key Focus Areas:**
    5.3.2.1.   **Modeling the Emergence of Hierarchical Complexity:** Investigating how stable, organized systems arise from autaxic principles, particularly through the interplay of *Critical State Transitions* (Dynamic V, Section 2.4.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and *Interactive Complexity Maximization* (Meta-Logic V, Section 2.4.2.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), constrained by Intrinsic Coherence (ontological closure, including compositional coherence and formal self-referential stability via stable fixed points, Section 2.6.2.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and utilizing definitionally emergent relational types and their composition rules (Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Chapter 8, 14 of *A New Way of Seeing*). This explores the mechanism behind the metaphysical claim of emergent complexity (Section 4.1.4 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)). (See Section 2.8.4 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how complexity arises from pattern composition).
    5.3.2.2.   **Autaxic Theory for Living Systems:** Developing an autaxic theory for the origin and fundamental characteristics of living systems (e.g., self-maintenance, pattern replication, adaptive behavior, metabolism-analogue) as complex autaxic patterns (Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) that achieve a high degree of ontological closure and self-constitution through intricate networks of definitionally emergent relational types and their compositions (Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Chapter 14, 16 of *A New Way of Seeing*). This provides a generative, process-based account for biological phenomena. (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how life is understood as a pattern).
    5.3.2.3.   **Emergence of Subjective Experience:** Investigating the necessary and sufficient conditions within autaxic patterning for the emergence of subjective experience, qualia, and self-awareness, focusing on the role of complex, integrated, recursive, self-referential patterns that achieve a critical threshold of ontological closure and formal self-referential stability (via stable fixed points, Section 2.6.2.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and utilize specific configurations of definitionally emergent relational types and their composition rules (Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Chapter 16 of *A New Way of Seeing*, Project 6.4 detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)). This directly addresses the philosophical problem of consciousness ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md), Section 4.4). This includes exploring how *Relational Processing* (Dynamic I, Section 2.4.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and *Intrinsic Coherence* (Meta-Logic I, Section 2.4.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) contribute to integrated conscious experience. (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how consciousness is understood as a pattern).
    5.3.2.4.   **Information Processing in Complex Systems:** Exploring the implications of autaxys for understanding information processing, storage, and self-modeling in complex systems, from biological networks to cognitive architectures, consistent with information’s derivative status (Chapter 9 of *A New Way of Seeing*, Section 2.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and framed as the processing of patterns composed of definitionally emergent relational types and their composition rules (Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)). This connects to the philosophical view of information (Section 4.1.1 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)). (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how patterns relate to information).
    5.3.2.5.   **Link to Previous Themes/Ideas:** Relates to “Stability Islands for Novel Complex Autaxic Patterns” (Idea 15, Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)) as regions of ontological closure and “Search for Signatures of Highly Complex/Proto-Mental Autaxic Patterning in Cosmological Data” (Idea 16, Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)) as potentially detectable complex patterns achieving high ontological closure. Addresses key open questions regarding the nature of consciousness (Section 3.7 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)).

**5.4. Pillar D: Autaxys Methodology, Validation, & Interdisciplinary Integration**
5.4.1.   **Strategic Intent:** This pillar continuously develops and refines the research methodology of **autology** (ARM, Section 7.0), establishes robust criteria for theory evaluation and validation, and fosters interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. This pillar is the operationalization of the epistemological principles of autology (Section 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)), particularly the Integrated Epistemology (Section 7.1 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)), and directly addresses the philosophical considerations of formalization (Section 3.5.3 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)) and ethical conduct (Section 7.7 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)). (Documented in the AFKB, Section 7.8 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).

5.4.2.   **Key Focus Areas:**
    5.4.2.1.   **Refining Principles of Autological Inquiry:** Further developing the principles and practices outlined in Section 7.0 (Autaxys Research Methodology) (Project 6.5 detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)), including the philosophical considerations guiding formalization (Section 3.5.3 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)) and the approach to integrating diverse formalisms (Section 3.5.4 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md), A1_ConceptualPaper_RelationalProcessing_IntrinsicCoherence_V20, Section 7.2). This grounds the methodology in the epistemological framework (Section 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).
    5.4.2.2.   **Developing Prediction Evaluation and Archiving Protocol (PEAP):** Establishing specific protocols for evaluating the coherence and potential testability of autaxic predictions, including assessing their derivation from formalized autaxic principles (including intrinsic drive, definitionally emergent types/composition rules, and ontological closure criteria, Section 2.5 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) and their uniqueness compared to other frameworks (as detailed in Section 7.5 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md), Project 6.5, and discussed in Chapter 15 of *A New Way of Seeing*). This operationalizes the epistemological goal of testable predictions (Section 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).
    5.4.2.3.   **Implementing Integrated Epistemology:** Operationalizing the practical implementation of the *Integrated Epistemology* (Section 7.2 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md), Chapter 17 of *A New Way of Seeing*), including best practices for combining insights from formal theory (including models based on definitionally emergent types/composition rules and ontological closure criteria), computational modeling, empirical data (where relevant), and potentially first-person contemplative data without compromising rigor or leading to methodological confusion? (As discussed conceptually in Section 7.1 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md) and Chapter 17 of *A New Way of Seeing*. This addresses the epistemological challenge, Section 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).
    5.4.2.4.   **Fostering Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Developing specific guidelines for fostering productive interdisciplinary collaborations (e.g., between physicists, mathematicians, philosophers, and complexity scientists) within the autaxys research program, leveraging the outputs of Project 6.1 (Section 7.6 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md), Section 11.3 in [Part VII: Strategic Planning](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)) and facilitating communication across different formal and conceptual languages. This supports the epistemological goal of interdisciplinary synthesis (Section 4.2 in [Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).
    5.4.2.5.   **Addressing Philosophical Implications:** Systematically addressing the philosophical implications of autaxys for epistemology, ontology, and the philosophy of science (as discussed in Chapter 17, 15 of *A New Way of Seeing*), including the philosophical implications of the chosen formalisms and the concept of ontological closure (Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)). This ensures the research is philosophically grounded and reflective ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md)).
    5.4.2.6.   **Link to Previous Themes/Ideas:** Directly incorporates “Autaxic Implications for Scientific Methodology & Experimentation” (Idea 3, 4, Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)). This pillar ensures the rigor and coherence of the research process itself.

**5.5. Pillar E: The Autaxic Table of Patterns & Novel Predictions**
5.5.1.   **Strategic Intent:** This pillar pursues the long-term goal of developing the **“Autaxic Table of Patterns”** (Section 2.8.5 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)) as a predictive and organizational framework for fundamental entities and interactions, and systematically explores other novel predictions arising from autaxys. (This relates to ideas 5, 15, 16 in Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)). This pillar aims to provide concrete, testable consequences derived from the metaphysical and formal foundations of autaxys ([Part IV: Philosophical Foundations & Implications](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_IV_Philosophical_Foundations.md), Section 4.1, Section 3.5 in [Part III: Autaxys in Context](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_III_Context_URFE.md)). (Documented in the AFKB, Section 7.8 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).

5.5.2.   **Key Focus Areas:**
    5.5.2.1.   **Developing the Autaxic Table Architecture:** Developing the theoretical basis and classification parameters for the Autaxic Table (Section 2.8.5 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), including its potential “autaxic quantum numbers” derived from autaxys’ dynamics (including the intrinsic drive (Section 2.5.2 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), definitionally emergent relational types and their composition rules (Section 2.5.3 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)), and the criteria for ontological closure/self-constitution, including formal self-referential stability via stable fixed points (Section 2.6.2.1 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md))) (Section 2.5 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md), Project 6.7 detailed in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)). This translates the process-pattern ontology into a predictive structure. (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how patterns relate to the Table).
    5.5.2.2.   **Re-evaluation of the Î₁ Pattern:** Critically re-evaluating and potentially refining predictions like the Î₁ (“Infoton”) particle within the full autaxys framework, assessing its potential existence and properties based on formalized autaxic principles (including intrinsic drive, definitionally emergent types/composition rules, and ontological closure criteria) (as detailed in Project 6.6, Relates to Idea 2, Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md), and discussion in Chapter 15 of *A New Way of Seeing*). This is a key test case for the predictive power of the formalized framework and the concept of ontological closure determining pattern viability (Section 2.6 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md)). (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how patterns are understood).
    5.5.2.3.   **Identifying Novel Patterns and Phenomena:** Systematically identifying and characterizing other potential novel patterns, forces, or phenomena predicted by autaxys, based on gaps or entailments within the formalized framework (e.g., forbidden states/transitions (Idea 20) as violations of ontological closure/coherence, new conservation laws (Idea 12) from Conservation of Distinguishability and ontological closure, signatures of proto-mental patterning (Idea 16) as specific complex coherent structures achieving high ontological closure, novel interaction modes (Idea 8) from definitionally emergent relational types, signatures of primordial dynamics (Idea 9) from the intrinsic drive, stability islands (Idea 15) as regions of ontological closure/stable fixed points, novel mass generation mechanisms (Idea 17) linked to pattern structure/dynamics/ontological closure) (Relates to Ideas 8, 9, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20 in Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)). These predictions are derived from the fundamental principles of generation and constraint. (See Section 2.8 in [Part II: Core Autaxic Concepts](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_II_Core_Concepts.md) for how patterns are understood).
    5.5.2.4.   **Proposing Experimental Searches:** Proposing experimental or observational searches for these novel predictions, including innovative methodological thinking for their detection (Relates to Ideas 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14 in Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)). This connects the theoretical predictions to empirical engagement (Section 7.3.2 in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_ARM.md)).
    5.5.2.5.   **Link to Previous Themes/Ideas:** Directly incorporates thematic areas like “Novel Autaxic Patterns” and “Autaxic Table of Patterns” from prior planning (Appendix 14.3 in [Part IX: Appendices](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Overview.md)). This pillar focuses on the more concrete, unique predictive output of autaxys.

These five pillars provide a comprehensive yet adaptable structure for organizing the multifaceted research program required to develop autaxys. Specific projects, detailed in Section 6.0 (in [`AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md`](AUTX_Master_Plan_v2.0_Part_V_Research_Projects.md)), will fall under one or more of these guiding pillars.
