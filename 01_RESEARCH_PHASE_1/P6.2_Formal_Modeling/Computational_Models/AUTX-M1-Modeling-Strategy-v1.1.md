### **1.0 Introduction and Evolved Strategy**

1.1.1 The central predictive goal of the Autaxys program is the derivation of the Autaxic Table of Patterns from first principles, as outlined in the *Unified Framework* (`D-P6.7-1`). This document details the evolved modeling strategy, incorporating insights from the *Autaxys Formal Mathematical Toolkit v2.0* (`D-P6.2-4`) and extending beyond the initial "Minimal Viable Universe" (MVU-1) to include the conceptualization and preliminary development of MVU-2, which focuses on multiverse/ensemble simulations.

1.1.2 This strategy outlines how the Autaxic Generative Engine (AGE), driven by local optimization of the Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A$), will be used not only to generate single universe timelines but also to explore the broader landscape of possible stable outcomes.

### **2.0 The Goal: Deriving the Autaxic Table of Patterns**

2.1.1 The Autaxic Table remains the target: a mapping of stable, self-consistent patterns ($P_{ID}$s) characterized by their emergent Autaxic Quantum Numbers (AQNs: $C, T, S, I_R$).
2.1.2 The objective is to populate this table by observing which patterns consistently emerge and stabilize across various simulation runs and parameter explorations.

### **3.0 The Generative Engine: Local Optimization and the Autaxic Lagrangian**

3.1.1 The core engine for all MVU simulations is the **Graph Rewriting System driven by Greedy Local Optimization**, as specified in `D-P6.2-4_Autaxys_Formal_Toolkit_v2.0.md`.
3.1.2 At each step, the system identifies all possible rule applications and selects the one that maximizes the immediate Autaxic Lagrangian ($L_A(G_{t+1})$) of the resulting state.
3.1.3 The form of $L_A(G)$ is critical. For initial MVUs, it is a proxy based on desired structural features and overall graph economy (e.g., as in `D-P6.2-5` for MVU-1). For more advanced simulations, $L_A(G)$ will evolve to more directly reflect aggregate $S/C$ ratios of emergent patterns.

### **4.0 Modeling Phases: From Single Universe to Multiverse Census**

4.1.1 **Phase 1: MVU-1 - Single Timeline Emergence (Reference: `D-P6.2-5`)**
    4.1.1.1 **Objective:** Test the fundamental hypothesis that stable, non-trivial patterns can emerge from a minimal rule set and proto-properties driven by local $L_A$ maximization in a single simulation run.
    4.1.1.2 **Methodology:**
        4.1.1.2.1 Implement the specific proto-properties, rules, and $L_A$ defined for MVU-1.
        4.1.1.2.2 Run single, extended simulations, starting from a "soup" of basic distinctions.
        4.1.1.2.3 Analyze the trajectory for the emergence and persistence of the target "bonded pair" pattern.
    4.1.1.3 **Output:** Validation of the core generative mechanism; identification of the first candidate $P_{ID}$s and their preliminary AQNs.

4.1.2 **Phase 2: MVU-2 - Multiverse Census and Stability Landscape Exploration**
    4.1.2.1 **Objective:** To move beyond single trajectories and explore the statistical distribution of stable outcomes. This addresses the possibility that a single run might get trapped in local optima or represent a rare outcome. The goal is to identify which patterns are robustly emergent across a wide range of initial conditions or stochastic variations.
    4.1.2.2 **Methodology:**
        4.1.2.2.1 **Ensemble Simulations:** Run a large number of independent MVU-1 (and later, more advanced MVU) simulations. Each run might start with slightly different initial numbers of distinctions or varied seeds for any stochastic rule components (if introduced).
        4.1.2.2.2 **Parameter Space Exploration (Future MVUs):** Systematically vary key parameters within the proto-property definitions, rule structures, or the $L_A$ function itself to map out the "phase space" of the Autaxic theory.
        4.1.2.2.3 **Data Collection:** For each completed simulation run (i.e., one that reaches a stable state or a defined termination condition), record the final graph state and its global $L_A$ score. Identify all persistent subgraphs ($P_{ID}$ candidates) and compute their AQNs.
        4.1.2.2.4 **Statistical Analysis:** Analyze the collected data to:
            4.1.2.2.4.1 Determine the frequency of emergence for different $P_{ID}$s.
            4.1.2.2.4.2 Identify correlations between initial parameters and final stable states or dominant patterns.
            4.1.2.2.4.3 Characterize the "attractor landscape" â€“ which stable configurations are common "destinations" for the system's evolution.
    4.1.2.3 **Output for Autaxic Table:**
        4.1.2.3.1 Patterns that consistently emerge with high stability ($S$) across many runs become strong candidates for fundamental entries in the Autaxic Table.
        4.1.2.3.2 The statistical distribution of AQNs for these common patterns provides insight into their typical properties.
    4.1.2.4 **Incorporating "Exploration Drive":** MVU-2 is also the ideal testbed for the "Exploration Drive" hypothesis. By comparing ensembles run with and without a stochastic exploration mechanism (especially in early, low-complexity states), we can assess if such a drive is necessary for the system to escape trivial local $L_A$ maxima and discover more complex, globally favorable stable patterns.

### **5.0 Iterative Refinement and Connection to Theory**

5.1.1 The results from both MVU-1 (single timeline) and MVU-2 (multiverse census) will feed back into refining the Autaxys framework:
    5.1.1.1 **Rule Set Evolution:** If simulations consistently fail to produce expected stability or complexity, or get stuck in trivial states, this indicates a need to revise the proto-property definitions, the rewrite rules, or the form of the $L_A$ function. The meta-dynamics conceptualized in the Unified Framework (algorithmic self-modification) can be manually mimicked by the researcher adjusting the model based on these outcomes.
    5.1.1.2 **AQN Calculation Refinement:** The process of identifying patterns and computing their AQNs from simulation data will refine the practical algorithms for these calculations, bridging the gap between their theoretical definitions (e.g., Kolmogorov Complexity) and their computable approximations.
    5.1.1.3 **Understanding the $L_A$ Landscape:** The multiverse simulations, in particular, will help map the "fitness landscape" defined by $L_A$, identifying peaks (stable states) and pathways between them.

### **6.0 Conclusion: A Two-Pronged Computational Strategy**

6.1.1 The Autaxys modeling strategy employs a two-pronged computational approach:
    6.1.1.1 **Detailed Single-Timeline Analysis (MVU-1 onwards):** To understand the step-by-step mechanics of pattern emergence and the specific sequence of rule applications leading to stability.
    6.1.1.2 **Broad Multiverse/Ensemble Analysis (MVU-2 onwards):** To identify statistically robust emergent patterns, understand the typicality of outcomes, and explore the stability landscape of the Autaxic theory.
6.1.2 This combined strategy, grounded in the v2.0 Formal Toolkit, provides a robust, iterative, and falsifiable path toward computationally deriving the Autaxic Table of Patterns and substantiating Autaxys as a predictive scientific theory.
